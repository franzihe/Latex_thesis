This chapter describes the instruments, the optimal estimation retrieval and the regional forecast model used in the scope of this study, to determine the snow water content in the vertical. The determination of required parameters from the measuring instruments in relation to the optimal estimation retrieval will be explained. The purpose of this study is to compare the vertical observations from the Haukeliseter measurement site and the output from the operational forecast model at the Norwegian Meteorological Institute for the extreme weather event during Christmas 2016. 
The last section will give an insight on how the data was analysed to compare the different systems.
