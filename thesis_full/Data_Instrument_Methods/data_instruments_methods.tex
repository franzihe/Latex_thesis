This chapter describes the data and method used in this study. 
The purpose of this study is to compare the meteorological observations from the Haukeliseter site and the output from the Norwegian operational forecast model %at the Norwegian Meteorological Institute 
for the extreme weather event during Christmas 2016. 
A strong focus lies on snow profiles following the measurement site, instruments, the optimal estimation retrieval and the regional forecast model used to determine the vertical profile of snow water content for observed snow events. 
%The determination of required parameters from the measuring instruments in relation to the optimal estimation retrieval will be explained. 
The last section will give an insight on how the data was analysed to compare the different systems.
