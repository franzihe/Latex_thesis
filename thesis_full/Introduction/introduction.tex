%%%%%%%%% INTRODUCTION %%%%%%%%%%%%%%
During Christmas 2016 a storm impinged on the west coast of Norway. The storm, called 'Urd' was according to \cite{olsen_ekstremvaerrapport._2017} associated with strong winds and high precipitation amounts. The midwind along the coast of Western Norway had hurricane strength (observed: \SIrange{40}{55}{\mPs}). In South and Eastern Norway west to north-west winds between \SIrange{25}{40}{\mPs} were measured. At the Haukeliseter measurement site, \SI{136.4}{\milli\metre} of precipitation were monitored during \SIrange{21}{27}{\dec}.
This event was just above the limit of been called an extreme weather. Storms of this kind are expected to occur on average every five years \citep{olsen_ekstremvaerrapport._2017}. \\ 
The financial costs associated with 'Urd' are estimated to about 180 million Norwegian kroner.
'Urd' led to major traffic problems for cars, trains, ferries and air planes. Most mountain crossings were kept closed during Christmas 2016. 
In addition, there was a power breakout of around 70.000 households and 40 emergency power stations failed during the extreme weather. 
\\
This extreme weather, might not have lead to the same damages as some of the extreme weather events of recent years. But since people are affected by extreme weather (\Cref{fig:news}) it is important to predict storms, associated precipitation and wind as accurately as possible. Having accurate observations, will lead to better performing models which rely on observations. \textcolor{red}{include a reference here}

\Cref{fig:news} shows that precipitation and strong winds can influence in certain ways the infrastructure. To predict and measure snowfall accumulation as accurately as possible is important since snowfall has impact on avalanches, freshwater release into water systems in spring, and extra economical expenses for local infrastructure as well as climatological effects. \\
\cite{joos_influence_2012} investigated the influence of microphysical processes on potential vorticity development in warm conveyor belts (WCB). They demonstrated the complex interaction between the small-scale microphyiscal processes and the large-scale flow in WCB. 
For the understanding of numerical simulations of storm developments it is important to know vertical precipitation profiles and their position within the synoptic vorticity environment. It is therefore crucial to study the vertical structure of different synoptic storms and  predict as accurately as possible.\\

Since November 2016, the Meteorological Cooperation on Operational Numerical Weather Prediction (MetCoOP) Ensemble Prediction forecast (MEPS) is operational at the Meteorological Institute of Norway (Met-Norway). The study by \cite{muller_arome-metcoop:_2017} shows that the AROME-MetCoOp, a version of the MÃ¨teo-France Applications of Research to Operations at Mesoscale, performs well for certain meteorological phenomena. \\
Microphysical processes in weather models are still not well understood and therefore are mostly parametrised \citep{muller_arome-metcoop:_2017}. Furthermore, high latitude regions are not well represented in meteorological models. Indeed a comparison between the MEPS data fit the observations for December 2016 but uncertainties are still present for this time period. 
\\
Some satellites, such as CloudSat have been equipped with radar to estimate snowfall rates and vertical profiles of precipitation. CloudSat is one of the satellites orbiting in the A-Train formation and measures the vertical structure of cloud systems \citep{stephens_cloudsat_2002}. 
\\
Studies of \cite{kulie_utilizing_2009} showed that the Cloud Profiling Radar (CPR), mounted on the CloudSat, can be used to estimate global distributions of snowfall. They showed that different combinations of microphyiscal habits and fall speed can lead to the same results of reflectivity and therefore to the same amount of snowfall rate.
Methods like optimal estimation retrieval were established to reduce the non-uniqueness. Where ground observations are used to estimate vertical profiles of precipitation.\\
The improvement of the CloudSat retrieval is helpful to show that climate models over estimate present-day Antarctic snowfall \citep{palerme_evaluation_2017}. \citet{norin_intercomparison_2015} presented a good agreement between the ground-based snowfall measurements and satellite observations.
