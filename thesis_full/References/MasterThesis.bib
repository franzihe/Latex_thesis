	abstract = {Estimates of snowfall rate as derived from radar reflectivities alone are non-unique. Different combinations of snowflake microphysical properties and particle fall speeds can conspire to produce nearly identical snowfall rates for given radar reflectivity signatures. Such ambiguities can result in retrieval uncertainties on the order of 100–200 \% for individual events. Here, we use observations of particle size distribution (PSD), fall speed, and snowflake habit from the Multi-Angle Snowflake Camera (MASC) to constrain estimates of snowfall derived from Ka-band ARM zenith radar (KAZR) measurements at the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) North Slope Alaska (NSA) Climate Research Facility site at Barrow. MASC measurements of microphysical properties with uncertainties are introduced into a modified form of the optimal-estimation CloudSat snowfall algorithm (2C-SNOW-PROFILE) via the a priori guess and variance terms. Use of the MASC fall speed, MASC PSD, and CloudSat snow particle model as base assumptions resulted in retrieved total accumulations with a −18 \% difference relative to nearby National Weather Service (NWS) observations over five snow events. The average error was 36 \% for the individual events. Use of different but reasonable combinations of retrieval assumptions resulted in estimated snowfall accumulations with differences ranging from −64 to +122 \% for the same storm events. Retrieved snowfall rates were particularly sensitive to assumed fall speed and habit, suggesting that in situ measurements can help to constrain key snowfall retrieval uncertainties. More accurate knowledge of these properties dependent upon location and meteorological conditions should help refine and improve ground- and space-based radar estimates of snowfall.},

The focus is on the "golden sample" case study for this type of analysis based on observations collected during the deployment of the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program's (ARM) mobile facility AMF2 at Hyytiälä, Finland, during the Biogenic Aerosols – Effects on Clouds and Climate (BAECC) field campaign. The presented analysis of the height evolution of the radar Doppler spectra is a state-of-the-art retrieval with profiling cloud radars in SLW layers beyond the traditional use of spectral moments. Dynamical effects are considered by following the particle population evolution along slanted tracks that are caused by horizontal advection of the cloud under wind shear conditions. In the SLW layer, the identified liquid peak is used as an air motion tracer to correct the Doppler spectra for vertical air motion and the ice peak is used to study the radar profiles of rimed particles. A 1-D steady-state bin microphysical model is constrained using the SLW and air motion profiles and cloud top radar observations. The observed radar moment profiles of the rimed snow can be simulated reasonably well by the model, but not without making several assumptions about the ice particle concentration and the relative role of deposition and aggregation. This suggests that in situ observations of key ice properties are needed to complement the profiling radar observations before process-oriented studies can effectively evaluate ice microphysical parameterizations.},

Precipitation measurements have a well-documented and mostly wind-dependent bias which is especially apparent during solid precipitation events. The resulting inaccuracy in precipitation data remains an area of concern in quantifying regional and global climate trends. As a high-latitude country, Norway has many solid precipitation events often accompanied by high wind speeds where the current adjustment functions have only limited validity. The presented study aims at improving the quality of solid precipitation data. In a comprehensive field experiment, precipitation data of standard automatic gauges are compared with data of a reference gauge surrounded by a double fence construction to minimize wind impact. Additional meteorological parameters are measured at the test site, allowing for an in-depth analysis of high-temporal-resolution precipitation data. The goal is to develop new adjustment functions for solid precipitation measurements which account for Norway's typical climate and are suitable for automated measurements. Measurements began in winter 2010/2011 at the alpine test site in southern Norway (chosen after a pre-study in 2009/2010) and will continue for two more winters. In this paper, the test site and its instrumentation are described and preliminary results are presented.},

A detailed study is presented which shows that the cloud optical thickness (τc) and effective particle radius (re) of water clouds can be determined solely from reflection function measurements at 0.75 and 2.16 μm, provided τc ≳ 4 and re ≳ 6 μm. For optically thin clouds the retrieval becomes ambiguous, resulting in two possible solutions for the effective radius and optical thickness. Adding a third channel near 1.65 μm does not improve the situation noticeably, whereas the addition of a channel near 3.70 μm reduces the ambiguity in deriving the effective radius. The effective radius determined by the above procedure corresponds to the droplet radius at some optical depth within the cloud layer. For clouds having τc ≳ 8, the effective radius determined using the 0.75 and 2.16 μm channels can be regarded as 85\%–95\% of the radius at cloud top, which corresponds in turn to an optical depth 20\%–40\% of the total optical thickness of the cloud layer.},

	abstract = {A method of remotely sensing integrated cloud liquid water over the oceans using spaceborne passive measurements from the special sensor microwave/imager (SSM/I) is described. The technique is comprised of a simple physical model that uses the 19.35- and 37-GHz channels of the SSM/I. The most comprehensive validation to date of cloud liquid water estimated from satellites is presented. This is accomplished through a comparison to independent ground-based microwave radiometer measurements of liquid water on San Nicolas Island, over the North Sea, and on Kwajalein and Saipan Islands in the western Pacific. In areas of marine stratocumulus clouds off the coast of California a further comparison is made to liquid water inferred from advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) visible reflectance measurements. The results are also compared qualitatively with near-coincident satellite imagery and with other existing microwave methods in selected regions. These comparisons indicate that the liquid water amounts derived from the simple scheme are consistent with the ground-based measurements for nonprecipitating cloud systems in the subtropics and middle to high latitudes. The comparison in the tropics, however, was less conclusive. Nevertheless, the retrieval method appears to have general applicability over most areas of the global oceans. An observational measure of the minimum uncertainty in the retrievals is determined in a limited number of known cloud-free areas, where the liquid water amounts are found to have a low variability of 0.016 kg m−2. A simple sensitivity and error analysis suggests that the liquid water estimates have a theoretical relative error typically ranging from about 25\% to near 40\% depending on the atmospheric/surface conditions and on the amount of liquid water present in the cloud. For the global oceans as a whole the average cloud liquid water is determined to be about 0.08 kg m−2. The major conclusion of this paper is that reasonably accurate amounts of cloud liquid water can be retrieved from SSM/I observations for nonprecipitating cloud systems, particularly in areas of persistent stratocumulus clouds, with less accurate retrievals in tropical regions.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces a radiative transfer model for the 9.6-μm ozone band that specifically matches the TIROS operational vertical sounder (TOVS) channel 9. The model is based on a spectral Malkmus band model for transmission. Band parameters were calculated by comparing to MODTRAN3 derived radiances. The effect of pressure on absorption is dealt with using a four-parameter approximation, and the improvements of this approximation over the more common Van de Hulst-Curtis-Godson scaling approximation are assessed. While this new model is exploited in the development of the retrieval described in this paper, the result has wider applicability to ozone climate problems requiring calculation of the radiative forcing associated with changing ozone. A two-layer version of the radiative transfer model is implemented in a retrieval scheme to obtain total ozone amounts from radiances measured by the TOVS instrument. Because the TOVS ozone channel is mainly sensitive to lower stratospheric ozone, ozone columns of the upper layer (above 30 hPa and with mean pressure of 10 hPa) are prescribed as a function of latitude. Ozone columns of the lower layer (mean pressure of 105 hPa) are then retrieved. The retrieval is based on a nonlinear optimal estimation algorithm and provides definition of error characteristics for every retrieval, which makes it possible to obtain a spatial distribution of the errors in the retrieval together with the spatial distribution of the retrieved total ozone column itself. This global distribution of the retrieval error and also of the contribution of a priori knowledge to the retrieval is presented to provide a validity of the ozone retrievals. Total ozone mapping spectrometer (TOMS) statistics are used as a priori information in the retrieval, and the 40-layer model is used to estimate the forward model error of the two-layer model. Comparisons of ozone retrievals for 1989 with TOMS total ozone measurements show good agreement both in time and in space with a rms difference between 1\% and 3\% for zonal means and 10\% for global gridded measurements.},

	abstract = {A new method for retrieving rainfall profiles from a spaceborne radar is introduced. As a result of the frequencies necessary in spaceborne radar applications, attenuation by both rainfall and liquid cloud particles is nonnegligible and must be accurately accounted for before quantitative rainfall estimates can be made. The proposed method is based on the minimization of a cost function that allows one to account for attenuation at each level directly in the iteration process. In addition, the algorithm does not invoke the Rayleigh approximation and is, therefore, applicable at wavelengths characteristic of spaceborne radars. The method is flexible with regard to the parameters to be retrieved and is well-suited for the addition of measurements from other sensors, such as a passive microwave radiometer, to constrain the retrieval. Preliminary results, using simplified assumptions of drop size distribution and particle shape, illustrate the utility of the algorithm provided the attenuation is not severe. At the frequency of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) precipitation radar (14 GHz), synthetic retrievals are accurate to within 20\% for rain rates up to 40 mm h−1. On the other hand, at 94 GHz, the frequency of the CloudSat cloud profiling radar, attenuation effects are too severe at rain rates greater than 1.5 mm h−1, suggesting the need for additional information to constrain the retrieval. Such information might come in the form of a path-integrated attenuation (PIA) derived from surface echo measurements or, alternatively, a precipitation water path (PWP) estimate from a passive microwave radiometer. Addition of a simple PWP constraint yields improvements in the retrieved rainfall profiles from both instruments when attenuation is severe. At 94 GHz, in particular, it is found that accurate quantitative rainfall estimates can be made provided the near-surface rain rate does not exceed 10 mm h−1.},

	abstract = {Cirrus clouds have a profound impact on the radiation balance of the Earth–atmosphere system. Accurate representation of their radiative properties is critical to understanding climate and predicting climate change. This paper casts the split-window cirrus cloud retrieval technique in an optimal estimation framework facilitating direct inclusion of explicit cloud boundary information from complementary sensors as well as providing a suite of diagnostic tools for evaluating the dominant sources of uncertainty in all retrieved quantities. Errors in retrieved microphysical properties are used to determine the resulting errors in the calculation of global-scale radiative budgets. Uncertainties in optical depth and effective radius are found to diminish from ∼45\% and ∼80\%, respectively, in the absence of explicit cloud boundary information to ∼15\% and ∼60\% when accurate radar-based or lidar-based estimates are included. It is demonstrated that the improvements to cirrus cloud optical properties afforded by accurate cloud boundary information may lead to as much as a factor of 3 increase in the accuracy to which their impact on the Earth's radiative balance can be modeled. Colocated infrared radiances from the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument aboard the Earth Observing System (EOS) Aqua satellite and cloud radar observations from the CloudSat satellite will soon allow the retrieval presented here to be integrated into an operational retrieval of the vertical distribution of cloud properties on a global scale.},

	abstract = {The authors investigate whether radar remote sensing of a certain class of ice clouds allows for characterization of the precipitation rates and aggregation processes. The NASA DC-8 collected the measurements in tropical anvils during July and August 2007 as part of the Tropical Composition, Cloud and Climate Coupling (TC4) experiment. Measured hydrometeor size distributions are used to estimate precipitation rates (P) and to solve the hydrodynamical collection equation. These distributions are also used to estimate radar reflectivity factors (Z) and Doppler velocities (Vd) at W, Ka, and Ku bands. Optimal estimation techniques are then used to estimate the uncertainty in retrieving P and aggregation rates (A) from combinations of Z and Vd. It is found that diagnosing information about A requires significant averaging and that a dual-frequency combination of W and Ka bands seems to provide the most information for the ice clouds sampled during TC4. Furthermore, the addition of Vd with expected uncertainty contributes little to the microphysical retrieval of either P or A. It is also shown that accounting for uncertainty in ice microphysical bulk density dominates the retrieval uncertainty in both P and A causing, for instance, the instantaneous uncertainty in retrieved P to increase from {\textasciitilde}30\% to {\textasciitilde}200\%.},

	abstract = {On average, the models in the Fifth Climate Model Intercomparison Project archive predict an increase in Antarctic precipitation from 5.5 to 24.5 \% between 1986–2005 and 2080–2099, depending on greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. This translates into a moderation of future sea level rise ranging from −19 to −71 mm between 2006 and 2099. However, comparison with CloudSat and ERA-Interim data show that almost all the models overestimate current Antarctic precipitation, some by more than 100 \%. If only the models that agree with CloudSat data within 20 \% of error are considered, larger precipitation changes (from 7.4 to 29.3 \%) and impact on sea level (from −25 to −85 mm) are predicted. A common practice of averaging all models to evaluate climate projections thus leads to a significant underestimation of the contribution of Antarctic precipitation to future sea level. Models simulate, on average, a 7.4 \%/°C precipitation change with surface temperature warming. The models in better agreement with CloudSat observations for Antarctic snowfall predict, on average, larger temperature and Antarctic sea ice cover changes, which could explain the larger changes in Antarctic precipitation simulated by these models. The agreement between the models, CloudSat data and ERA-Interim is generally less in the interior of Antarctica than at the peripheries, but the interior is also where climate change will induce the smallest absolute change in precipitation. About three-quarters of the impact on sea level will result from precipitation change over the half most peripheral and lowest elevation part of the surface of Antarctica.},

	abstract = {Accurate snowfall estimates are important for both weather and climate applications. Ground-based weather radars and space-based satellite sensors are often used as viable alternatives to rain gauges to estimate precipitation in this context. In particular, the Cloud Profiling Radar (CPR) on board CloudSat is proving to be a useful tool to map snowfall globally, in part due to its high sensitivity to light precipitation and its ability to provide near-global vertical structure. CloudSat snowfall estimates play a particularly important role in the high-latitude regions as other ground-based observations become sparse and passive satellite sensors suffer from inherent limitations. In this paper, snowfall estimates from two observing systems – Swerad, the Swedish national weather radar network, and CloudSat – are compared. Swerad offers a well-calibrated data set of precipitation rates with high spatial and temporal resolution, at very high latitudes. The measurements are anchored to rain gauges and provide valuable insights into the usefulness of CloudSat CPR's snowfall estimates in the polar regions. In total, 7.2 × 105 matchups of CloudSat and Swerad observations from 2008 through 2010 were intercompared, covering all but the summer months (June to September). The intercomparison shows encouraging agreement between the two observing systems despite their different sensitivities and user applications. The best agreement is observed when CloudSat passes close to a Swerad station (46–82 km), where the observational conditions for both systems are comparable. Larger disagreements outside this range suggest that both platforms have difficulty with shallow snow but for different reasons. The correlation between Swerad and CloudSat degrades with increasing distance from the nearest Swerad station, as Swerad's sensitivity decreases as a function of distance. Swerad also tends to overshoot low-level precipitating systems further away from the station, leading to an underestimation of snowfall rate and occasionally to missing precipitation altogether. Several statistical metrics – including the probability of detection, false alarm rate, hit rate, and Pierce's skill score – are calculated. The sensitivity of these metrics to the snowfall rate, as well as to the distance from the nearest radar station, are summarised. This highlights the strengths and the limitations of both observing systems at the lower and upper ends of the snowfall distributions as well as the range of uncertainties that can be expected from these systems in high-latitude regions.},

	abstract = {A new method to automatically classify solid hydrometeors based on Multi-Angle Snowflake Camera (MASC) images is presented. For each individual image, the method relies on the calculation of a set of geometric and texture-based descriptors to simultaneously identify the hydrometeor type (among six predefined classes), estimate the degree of riming and detect melting snow. The classification tasks are achieved by means of a regularized multinomial logistic regression (MLR) model trained over more than 3000 MASC images manually labeled by visual inspection. In a second step, the probabilistic information provided by the MLR is weighed on the three stereoscopic views of the MASC in order to assign a unique label to each hydrometeor. The accuracy and robustness of the proposed algorithm is evaluated on data collected in the Swiss Alps and in Antarctica. The algorithm achieves high performance, with a hydrometeor-type classification accuracy and Heidke skill score of 95 \% and 0.93, respectively. The degree of riming is evaluated by introducing a riming index ranging between zero (no riming) and one (graupel) and characterized by a probable error of 5.5 \%. A validation study is conducted through a comparison with an existing classification method based on two-dimensional video disdrometer (2DVD) data and shows that the two methods are consistent.},

The study also treats steady two-dimensional air circulations in which time-dependent distributions of water vapor, cloud and precipitation respond to model microphysical processes.The approach throughout is essentially kinematic, although results provide numerous insights into the dynamical properties of a cloudy or stormy atmosphere. Water distributions are explained in relation to the air’s horizontal divergence, vertical velocity and compressibility, and physical pictures are presented frequently.

	abstract = {Precipitation measurements exhibit large cold-season biases due to under-catch in windy conditions. These uncertainties affect water balance calculations, snowpack monitoring and calibration of remote sensing algorithms and land surface models. More accurate data would improve the ability to predict future changes in water resources and mountain hazards in snow-dominated regions.  In 2010, a comprehensive test site for precipitation measurements was established on a mountain plateau in southern Norway. Automatic precipitation gauge data are compared with data from a precipitation gauge in a Double Fence Intercomparison Reference (DFIR) wind shield construction which serves as the reference. A large number of other sensors are provided supporting data for relevant meteorological parameters.  In this paper, data from three winters are used to study and determine the wind-induced under-catch of solid precipitation. Qualitative analyses and Bayesian statistics are used to evaluate and objectively choose the model that best describes the data. A continuous adjustment function and its uncertainty are derived for measurements of all types of winter precipitation (from rain to dry snow). A regression analysis does not reveal any significant misspecifications for the adjustment function, but shows that the chosen model does not describe the regression noise optimally. The adjustment function is operationally usable because it is based only on data available at standard automatic weather stations.  The results show a non-linear relationship between under-catch and wind speed during winter precipitation events and there is a clear temperature dependency, mainly reflecting the precipitation type. The results allow, for the first time, derivation of an adjustment function based on measurements above 7 m s−1. This extended validity of the adjustment function shows a stabilization of the wind-induced precipitation loss for higher wind speeds.},

It is widely used in teaching school and undergraduate courses on climate.

Here we have produced a new global map of climate using the Köppen-Geiger system based on a large global data set of long-term monthly precipitation and temperature station time series. Climatic variables used in the Köppen-Geiger system were calculated at each station and interpolated between stations using a two-dimensional (latitude and longitude) thin-plate spline with tension onto a 0.1°×0.1° grid for each continent. We discuss some problems in dealing with sites that are not uniquely classified into one climate type by the Köppen-Geiger system and assess the outcomes on a continent by continent basis. Globally the most common climate type by land area is BWh (14.2\%, Hot desert) followed by Aw (11.5\%, Tropical savannah).

	abstract = {A dataset consisting of one year of CloudSat Cloud Profiling Radar (CPR) near-surface radar reflectivity Z associated with dry snowfall is examined in this study. The CPR observations are converted to snowfall rates S using derived Ze–S relationships, which were created from backscatter cross sections of various nonspherical and spherical ice particle models. The CPR reflectivity histograms show that the dominant mode of global near-surface dry snowfall has extremely light reflectivity values (∼3–4 dBZe), and an estimated 94\% of all CPR dry snowfall observations are less than 10 dBZe. The average conditional global snowfall rate is calculated to be about 0.28 mm h−1, but is regionally highly variable as well as strongly sensitive to the ice particle model chosen. Further, ground clutter contamination is found in regions of complex terrain even when a vertical reflectivity continuity threshold is utilized. The potential of future multifrequency spaceborne radars is evaluated using proxy 35–13.6-GHz reflectivities and sensor specifications of the proposed Global Precipitation Measurement dual-frequency precipitation radar (DPR). It is estimated that because of its higher detectability threshold, only about 7\%–1\% of the near-surface radar reflectivity values and about 17\%–4\% of the total accumulation associated with global dry snowfall would be detected by a DPR-like instrument, but these results are very sensitive to the chosen ice particle model. These potential detection shortcomings can be partially mitigated by using snowfall-rate distributions derived by the CPR or other similar high-frequency active sensors.},

	abstract = {A Bayesian optimal estimation retrieval is used to determine probability density functions of snow microphysical parameters from ground-based observations taken during four snowfall events in southern Ontario, Canada. The retrieved variables include the parameters of power laws describing particle mass and horizontally projected area. The results reveal nontrivial correlations between mass and area parameters that were not apparent in prior studies. The observations provide information mainly about the mass coefficient , somewhat less information about the mass exponent  and the projected area coefficient , and minimal information about the projected area exponent . The expected values for retrieved mass power-law parameters  = 0.003 28 and  = 2.25 are consistent with those from several prior studies that looked at the mass of aggregate-like particles and precipitating ice aloft as functions of maximum particle dimension. Differences from other studies appear related to differences in the dimensions used to define particle size. The retrieval allows the analysis of relatively large volumes of continuous observations, greatly enhancing sampling relative to single-particle analyses. The retrieved properties are used to constrain 94-GHz (W band) radar scattering properties for a variety of snow particle shapes. Synthetic reflectivities calculated using these scattering properties and observed particle size distributions show that a branched, spatial aggregate-like particle produces good agreement with coincident observed W-band reflectivities. Uncertainties in the synthetic reflectivities, estimated by applying a simple error-propagation model, are substantial and are dominated by the uncertainties in  and .},

Representations of PV on isentropic or isobaric surfaces can be cumbersome, as analyses of several surfaces spanning the troposphere must be constructed to fully apprehend the complete PV distribution. Following a brief review of the relationship between PV and nearly balanced flows, it is demonstrated that the tropospheric PV has a simple distribution, and as a consequence, an analysis of potential temperature along the dynamic tropopause (here defined as a surface of constant PV) allows for a simple representation of the upper-tropospheric and lower-stratospheric PV. The construction and interpretation of these tropopause maps, which may be termed “isertelic” analyses of potential temperature, are described. In addition, techniques to construct dynamical representations of the lower-tropospheric PV and near-surface potential temperature, which complement these isertelic analyses, are also suggested. Case studies are presented to illustrate the utility of these techniques in diagnosing phenomena such as cyclogenesis, tropopause folds, the formation of an upper trough, and the effects of latent heat release on the upper and lower troposphere.},

	abstract = {The long-standing observational view of cyclogenesis involves an interaction between tropopause- and surface-based finite-amplitude disturbances. There are, however, instances where more than one upper-level disturbance contributes to low-level development. A subset of these events involves wave (or trough) merger, which has been defined as the amalgamation of two or more distinct 500-hPa vorticity maxima. An example of this phenomenon involving a case of very intense continental cyclogenesis (25–26 January 1978) over the eastern United States is selected to elucidate the origin and evolution of precursor disturbances, from the planetary scale to the mesoscale. The analysis of this event reveals that the two well-defined tropopause-based disturbances that contribute to cyclogenesis have distinctly different origins and are brought together by confluent planetary-scale flow. One of these disturbances originates over the western North Pacific Ocean 10 days prior to cyclogenesis and tracks eastward toward western North America. The other disturbance originates over Siberia, tracks over the North Pole, and then southward through central Canada. As the upper disturbances come together, a surface cyclone deepens 43 hPa in 24 h, reaching a minimum sea level pressure of 955 hPa over southern Ontario, and establishing all-time low sea level pressure records for a large portion of the Ohio Valley and southern Ontario. Wave merger in this case consists of a close approach of the two upper-level precursor vorticity centers, rather than an amalgamation. The upper-level disturbances are found to translate conservatively (in terms of potential vorticity) and to attain maximum amplitude prior to cyclogenesis. Both disturbances are highly anomalous, with the dynamic tropopause locally depressed to near 800 hPa. Diabatic effects appear to alter the upper-level disturbance that originated over the Pacific late in the life cycle of the cyclone. The surface response to the upper-level disturbances is a multiple-low-center configuration, with the main cyclone forming and deepening in relatively colder air behind a prominent preexisting depression. On the basis of this observation, the importance of surface precursor disturbances is questioned in cases characterized by strong upper-level dynamics. A highly amplified thermal wave accompanies the cyclone at the ground and tropopause. At the ground, the wave results from a large-scale rotation of preexisting arctic and coastal/warm frontal boundaries, which follow closely the tracks of the two upper-level disturbances. The main surface cyclone develops in the zone between these preexisting fronts. The tropopause thermal wave consists primarily of contributions from the highly localized precursors and, thus, cannot be viewed as the result of the nonlinear amplification of a wave or wave packet on a background potential temperature field. The foregoing results suggest a generalization of conceptual and theoretical models of cyclogenesis to include multiple upper-level precursor disturbances, a flexible upper boundary (tropopause), and “one way” baroclinic development in which upper-level disturbances attain maximum amplitude prior to surface cyclogenesis.},

	abstract = {The ability of CloudSat to detect precipitation in cold season cloud systems is examined using data from the Environment Canada C band weather radar at King City, Ontario. The factors complicating the comparison are the time mismatch, the differences in sensitivity, and the changes to the geometry of cross section with range from the ground radar, W band radar attenuation, and the effect of ground clutter. A total of 40 overpasses with precipitation were observed over the King City radar from September 2006 to April 2007. In about 14\% of the precipitation profiles, time mismatches were diagnosed. When these cases were removed, the skill scores of the CloudSat precipitation occurrence product were excellent. The most frequent cause of a false detection was an incorrect precipitation threshold in the algorithm. The most frequent cause of a miss in detection was ground clutter removal of valid echoes by the algorithm. Overall, the CloudSat algorithm handled the effect of attenuation very well. Improvement to the algorithm would arise from a better tuning of the precipitation threshold, a threshold of −10 dBZ instead of −18 dBZ being more appropriate for winter storms in the Great Lakes area, and more effective ground clutter filtering in the lowest four range bins of the CloudSat data. The methodology employed here and the 1456 verified precipitation profiles from CloudSat can serve as a framework for a test bed to evaluate precipitation products from CloudSat.},

	abstract = {Narrow corridors of water vapor transport known as atmospheric rivers (ARs) contribute to extreme precipitation and flooding along the West Coast of the United States, but knowledge of their influence over the interior is limited. Here, the authors use Interim European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Re-Analysis (ERA-Interim) data, Climate Prediction Center (CPC) precipitation analyses, and Snowpack Telemetry (SNOTEL) observations to describe the characteristics of cool-season (November–April) ARs over the western United States. It is shown that AR frequency and duration exhibit a maximum along the Oregon–Washington coast, a strong transition zone upwind (west) of and over the Cascade–Sierra ranges, and a broad minimum that extends from the “high” Sierra south of Lake Tahoe eastward across the central Great Basin and into the deep interior. East of the Cascade–Sierra ranges, AR frequency and duration are largest over the interior northwest, while AR duration is large compared to AR frequency over the interior southwest. The fractions of cool-season precipitation and top-decile 24-h precipitation events attributable to ARs are largest over and west of the Cascade–Sierra ranges. Farther east, these fractions are largest over the northwest and southwest interior, with distinctly different large-scale patterns and AR orientations enabling AR penetration into each of these regions. In contrast, AR-related precipitation over the Great Basin east of the high Sierra is rare. These results indicate that water vapor depletion over major topographic barriers is a key contributor to AR decay, with ARs playing a more prominent role in the inland precipitation climatology where lower or less continuous topography facilitates the inland penetration of ARs.},

	abstract = {One of the challenges that limit the amount of information that can be inferred from radar measurements of ice and mixed-phase precipitating clouds is the variability in ice mass within hydrometeors. The variable amount of ice mass within particles of a given size drives further variability in single-scattering properties that results in uncertainties of forward-modeled remote sensing quantities. Nonspherical ice-phase hydrometeors are often approximated as spheroids to simplify the calculation of single-scattering properties, yet offline calculations remain necessary to quantify these radiative properties as a function of size in discrete increments. In this paper, a simple scaling of the Clausius–Mossotti factor is used that allows for an approximation of the scattering and extinction cross sections for an arbitrary mass–dimensional power-law relationship of a nonspherical particle given a single T-matrix calculation. Using data collected by the University of Wyoming King Air in snow clouds over the Colorado Park Range, the uncertainty in forward-modeled radar reflectivity to assumptions regarding mass–dimensional relationships is examined. This is accomplished by taking advantage of independently measured condensed mass and particle size distributions to estimate the variability of the prefactor in the mass–dimensional power law. Then, calculating the partial derivative of the radar backscatter cross sections using the scaling relationships, an estimate is made of the statistical uncertainty in forward-modeled radar reflectivity. Uncertainties on the order of 4 dB are found in this term for the dataset considered.},

An SVI utilizes a video camera with sufficient frame rate, pixels, and shutter speed to record thousands of snowflake images. The camera housing and lighting produce little airflow distortion, so SVI data are quite representative of natural conditions, which is important for volumetric data products such as snowflake size distributions. Long-duration, unattended operation of an SVI is feasible because datalogging software provides data compression and the hardware can operate for months in harsh winter conditions. Details of SVI hardware and field operation are given. Snowflake size distributions (SSDs) from a storm near Boulder, Colorado, are computed. An SVI is an imaging system, so SVI data can be utilized to compute diverse data products for various applications. In this paper, the authors present visualizations of frozen particles (i.e., snowflake aggregates as well as individual crystals), which provide insight into the weather conditions such as temperature, humidity, and winds.},

Power functions describing the variation of mass and horizontally projected area with particle size and a parameter related to particle shape are retrieved from near-Rayleigh radar reflectivity, particle size distribution, snowfall rate, and size-resolved particle fall speeds. Algorithm performance is explored in the context of instruments deployed during the Canadian CloudSat CALIPSO Validation Project, but the algorithm is adaptable to other similar combinations of sensors. Critical estimates of observational and forward model uncertainties are developed and used to quantify the performance of the method using synthetic cases developed from actual observations of snow events. In addition to illustrating the technique, the results demonstrate that this combination of sensors provides useful constraints on the mass parameters and on the coefficient of the area power function but only weakly constrains the exponent of the area power function and the shape parameter. Information content metrics show that about two independent quantities are measured by the suite of observations and that the method is able to resolve about eight distinct realizations of the state vector containing the mass and area power function parameters. Alternate assumptions about observational and forward model uncertainties reveal that improved modeling of particle fall speeds could contribute substantial improvements to the performance of the method.},

	abstract = {This paper describes the results of analysis of over 825 000 profiles of millimeter-wave radar (MWR) reflectivities primarily collected by zenith-pointing surface radars observing tropical convection associated with various phases of activity of the large-scale tropical circulation. The data principally analyzed in this paper come from surface observations obtained at the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Manus site during active and break episodes of the Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO) and from observations collected from a shipborne radar during an active phase of the monsoon over the Indian Ocean during the Joint Air–Sea Monsoon Interaction Experiment. It was shown, for example, in a histogram regime analysis that the MWR data produce statistics on convection regimes similar in most respects to the analogous regime analysis of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission radar–radiometer observations. Attenuation of the surface MWRs by heavy precipitation, however, incorrectly shifts a small fraction of the deeper precipitation modes into the shallow modes of precipitation. The principal findings are the following. (i) The cloud and precipitation structures of the different convective regimes are largely identical regardless of the mode of synoptic forcing, that is, regardless of whether the convection occurred during an active phase of the MJO, a transition phase of the MJO, or in an active monsoon period. What changes between these synoptically forced modes of convection are the relative frequencies of occurrences of the different storm regimes. (ii) The cloud structures associated with the majority of cases of observed precipitation (ranging in occurrence from 45\% to 53\% of all precipitation profiles) were multilayered structures regardless of the mode of synoptic forcing. The predominant multilayered cloud mode was of higher-level cirrus of varying thickness overlying cumulus congestus–like convection. (iii) The majority of water accumulated (i.e., 53\%–63\%) over each of the periods assigned to the active monsoon (5 days of data), the active MJO (38 days of data), and the transition MJO (53 days of data) fell from these multiple-layered cloud systems. (iv) Solar transmittances reveal that significantly less sunlight (reductions of about 30\%–50\%) reaches the surface in the precipitating regimes than reaches the surface under drizzle and cloud-only conditions, suggesting that the optical thicknesses of precipitation-bearing clouds significantly exceeds those of nonprecipitating clouds.},

	abstract = {The need for measuring snowfall is driven by the roles snow plays providing freshwater resources and affecting climate. Snow accumulations are an important resource for ecological and human needs and in many areas appear vulnerable to climate change. Snow cover modifies surface heat fluxes over areas extensive enough to influence climate at regional and perhaps global scales. Seasonal runoff from snowmelt, along with over-ocean snowfall, contributes to freshening in the Arctic and high-latitude North Atlantic oceans. Yet much of the Earth's area for which snowfall plays such significant roles is not well-monitored by observations.
Radar reflectivity at 94 GHz is sensitive to scattering by snow particles and CloudSat, in a near-polar orbit, provides vertically resolved measurements of 94 GHz reflectivity at latitudes from 82 N to 82 S. While not global in areal coverage, CloudSat does provide observations sampled from regions where snowfall is the dominant form of precipitation and an important component of hydrologic processes. The work presented in this study seeks to exploit these observations by developing and assessing a physically-base snowfall retrieval which uses an explicit representation of snow microphysical properties.
As the reflectivity-based snowfall retrieval problem is significantly underconstrained, a priori information about snow microphysical properties is required. The approaches typically used to develop relations between reflectivity and snowfall rate, so-called Ze-S relations, require assumptions about particle properties such as mass, area, fallspeed, and shape. Limited information about the distributions of these properties makes difficult the characterization of how uncertainties in the properties influence uncertainties in the Ze-S relations.
To address this, the study proceeded in two parts. In the first, probability distributions for snow particle microphysical properties were assessed using optimal estimation applied to multi-sensor surface-based snow observations from a field campaign. Mass properties were moderately well determined by the observations, the area properties less so. The retrieval revealed nontrivial correlations between mass and area parameters not apparent in prior studies. Synthetic testing showed that the performance of the retrieval was hampered by uncertainties in the fallspeed forward model. The mass and area properties obtained from this retrieval were used to construct particle models including 94 GHz scattering properties for dry snow. These properties were insufficient to constrain scattering properties to match observed 94 GHz reflectivities. Vertical aspect ratio supplied a sufficient additional constraint.
In the second part, the CloudSat retrieval, designed to estimate vertical profiles of snow size distribution parameters from reflectivity profiles, was applied to measurements from the field campaign and from an orbit of CloudSat observations. Uncertainties in the mass and area microphysical properties, obtained from the first part of this study, were substantial contributors to the uncertainties in the retrieved snowfall rates. Snowfall rate fractional uncertainties were typically 140\% to 200\%. Accumulations of snowfall calculated from the retrieval results matched observed accumulations to within 13\%, however, when allowances were made for snowfall with properties likely inconsistent with the snow particle model. Information content metrics showed that the size distribution slope parameters were moderately to strongly constrained by the reflectivity observations, while the intercept parameters were determined primarily by the a priori constraints. Results from the CloudSat orbit demonstrated the ability of the CloudSat retrieval to represent a range of scene-dependent Ze-S relations.},

	abstract = {Using airborne data from several recent field projects, the authors have taken another look at the properties of exponential ice particle size distributions (PSDs) when the PSDs are broad. Two primary questions are addressed: for what ranges of ice water content (IWC) and equivalent radar reflectivity (Ze) do exponentials produce accurate estimates of these higher moments of the PSD, and why is there a lower limit to the value to the slope of exponential fits to PSD, λ, as has been found from airborne measurements? Earlier studies at temperatures primarily above −10°C have found that λ measured in snow during spiral descents through deep ice cloud layers decreases to about 9 cm−1 and then remains there. Several physical processes have been advanced to explain these observations. If reliable, the data could be used to improve retrieval of ice cloud properties through remote sensing and for cloud model representations of ice cloud microphysical properties. For data acquired from 2D probes, recent evidence indicates shattering of large ice particles ahead of, but attributable to, the probe’s sensing area, generating small crystals that the probe then senses. Shattered artifacts have been objectively removed from the data. Comparisons of size distributions before and after removal of suspected shattered particles suggest that the reported minimum may have been due to shattering and/or other instrument errors. The revised PSDs indicate that for λ {\textless} 40 cm−1, 0.1 g m−1 {\textless} IWC, and 5 dB {\textless} Ze, moments two (IWC) through four (Ze) of the PSD are dominated by particles larger than a few hundred microns. Analytical representations with more variables than exponentials (e.g., gamma PSD) are not required to accurately derive these moments from the PSD. In these situations, the intercept parameter of the exponential PSD, N0 ≈ 1 cm−4, is 5 to 30 times larger than assumed earlier.},

	abstract = {There has been so far no global estimate of snowfall. CloudSat has, for the first time, provided an opportunity for us to conduct such an estimate. The present study seizes this opportunity and attempts to investigate the global snowfall characteristics using its cloud radar observations. The retrieval methodology developed in this study includes two parts: first, determining whether a radar echo corresponds to snowfall (instead of rainfall), and second, converting radar reflectivity to snowfall rate. The first part is a snow?rain threshold based on multiyear land station and shipboard present weather reports, and the second part is based on backscatter computations of nonspherical ice particles and in situ measured particle size distributions. Using the above retrieval method, global CloudSat data over 1 year were analyzed. The results show the following. (1) In the Southern Hemisphere, there is an almost zonally orientated high snowfall zone centered around 60°S, where both snowfall frequency and rate are high. In the Northern Hemisphere, however, heavy/frequent snowfall areas are mostly locked to geographical locations. (2) Zonally and annually averaged snowfall rate has its maximum value around 2 mm d?1, which is about one third of the zonally averaged rainfall values found in the tropics, signifying the importance of snowfall in hydrological cycle. (3) Vertical profiles of snowfall rate have the greatest variability in the lowest levels. While near?surface snowfall rate generally increases with cloud top height, there seems to be two prevailing groups of clouds with very different growth rate of snowfall as cloud top height increases. (4) The characteristics of the vertical distribution of snowfall rate are quite similar for over?ocean and over?land snow clouds, except that over?land snow clouds seem to be somewhat shallower than those over ocean.},

It can be used in offline mode (from point scale to global runs) or fully coupled with an atmospheric model. SURFEX is able to simulate fluxes of carbon dioxide, chemical species, continental aerosols, sea salt and snow particles. It also includes a data assimilation module. The main principles of the organization of the surface are described first. Then, a survey is made of the scientific module (including the coupling strategy). Finally the main applications of the code are summarized. The current applications are extremely diverse, ranging from surface monitoring and hydrology to numerical weather prediction and global climate simulations. The validation work undertaken shows that replacing the pre-existing surface models by SURFEX in these applications is usually associated with improved skill, as the numerous scientific developments contained in this community code are used to good advantage.},

	abstract = {A novel method is introduced to generate climatological frequency distributions of meteorological features from gridded datasets. The method is used here to derive a climatology of extratropical cyclones from sea level pressure (SLP) fields. A simple and classical conception of cyclones is adopted where a cyclone is identified as the finite area that surrounds a local SLP minimum and is enclosed by the outermost closed SLP contour. This cyclone identification procedure can be applied to individual time instants, and climatologies of cyclone frequency, fc, are obtained by simple time averaging. Therefore, unlike most other climatologies, the method is not based on the application of a tracking algorithm and considers the size of cyclones. In combination with a conventional cyclone center tracking algorithm that allows the determination of cyclone life times and the location of cyclogenesis and cyclolysis, additional frequency fields can be obtained for special categories of cyclones that are generated in, move through, or decay in a specified geographical area. The method is applied to the global SLP dataset for the time period 1958–2001 from the latest 40-yr European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Re-Analysis (ERA-40). In the Northern Hemisphere and during winter, the cyclone frequency field has three maxima in the Pacific storm track (with fc up to 35\%), the Atlantic storm track (with fc up to 32\%), and the Mediterranean (with fc up to 15\%). During the other seasons the fc values are generally reduced in midlatitudes and the subtropical monsoon areas appear as regions with enhanced fc. In the Southern Hemisphere, the seasonal variations are smaller with year-round maxima of fc in the belt from 50° to 70°S (along the coast of Antarctica, with maximum values of almost 40\%) and to the east of the Andes (with fc up to 35\% during summer). Application of a lifetime threshold value significantly reduces fc, in particular over and close to the continents. Subsets of cyclone frequency fields are calculated for several subjectively chosen regions of cyclone genesis, passage, and lysis. They show some interesting aspects of the behavior of extratropical cyclones; cyclones that decay along the U.S. West Coast, for instance, have a short lifetime and originate almost exclusively from the eastern North Pacific, whereas long-lived and long-distance Pacific cyclones terminate farther north in the Gulf of Alaska. The approach to calculate frequency distributions of atmospheric flow structures as introduced in this study can be easily applied to gridded data from global atmospheric models and assimilation systems. It combines the counts of atmospheric features with their area of influence, and hence provides a robust and easily interpretable measure of key meteorological structures when comparing and evaluating different analysis datasets and climate model integrations. Further work is required to comprehensively exploit the presented global ERA-40 cyclone climatology, in particular, aspects of its interannual variability.},

Results from simulations using these schemes are contrasted with each other, with an ice-free control simulation, and with observations to determine to what extent ice physics affect the realism of these results. Two different types of tropical convection are simulated. Tropical squall-type systems are simulated in two dimensions so that a large domain can be used to incorporate a complete anvil. Nonsquall-type convective lines are simulated in three dimensions owing to their smaller horizontal scale. The inclusion of ice processes enhances the agreement of the simulated convection with some features of observed convection, including the proportion of surface rainfall in the anvil region, and the intensity and structure of the radar brightband near the melting level in the anvil. In the context of our experimental design, the use of three ice classes produces better results than two ice classes or ice-free conditions, and for the tropical cumuli, the optimal mix of the bulk ice hydrometeors is cloud ice-snow-graupel. We infer from our modeling results that application of bulk ice microphysics in cloud models might be case specific, which is a significant limitation. This can have serious ramifications for microwave interpretation of cloud microphysical properties. Generalization of ice processes may require a larger number of ice categories than we have evaluated and/or the prediction of hydrometeor concentrations or particle-size spectra.},

	abstract = {A two-dimensional nonhydrostatic cloud model is applied to the simulation of a tropical squall line that occurred on 23 June during the COPT 81 experiment. Owing to the use of an ice parameterization scheme, the simulation reproduces many interesting features of the stratiform part observed with Doppler radars. In particular, this includes the dynamical, thermodynamical, and microphysical structures of the stratiform part. Different parts are clearly identified from the simulation and observations: a leading convective zone 40-km wide with large precipitation; a developed stratiform zone stretching over 150 km with moderate precipitation; between these two regions, a transition zone 20-km wide giving only light precipitation; and a forward anvil near 12 km. The mean horizontal circulation is characterized by two mean flows: the front-to-rear flow that represents upward and rearward injection of boundary-layer air and the underlying rear-to-front flow. The simulated vertical velocity, except in the convective part, is in good agreement with observations and is characterized by a mesoscale updraft in the midtroposphere just behind the transition zone and a mesoscale downdraft under the anvil. The level of zero vertical motion, separating the mesoscale updraft from the mesoscale downdraft, has a weak slope in the horizontal as observed, and stays under the 0°C isotherm everywhere. One consequence is that the bright band is embedded in the mesoscale ascent. Detailed thermodynamical and microphysical budgets of the stratiform region are performed and lead to the following conclusions for the present simulation: 1) the warming in the poststratiform part is a consequence of the history of the storm when the subsiding low levels were dry; 2) the cooling in the mesoscale downdraft is mainly due to rainwater evaporation; 3) this net cooling is a temporal process that occurs when the stratiform anvil produced enough precipitation to counter the adiabatic warming; 4) the cooling at the base of the anvil is not due to melting but is the consequence of upward transport of low θ. The apparent heat source and moisture sink of the whole system, as well as those of the convective and stratiform parts, are also presented at different times and compared with previous numerical results and observations.},

The model was able to reproduce the intense and moderate convective rain of IOPs 2A and 3, respectively, and also the stratiform precipitation associated with IOP 8. Microphysical budget computations were used to derive the mean vertical distribution of the hydrometeors and to quantify the relationships among the different water species. The results of IOP 8 exhibit a shallow stratiform system in which the dominant ice hydrometeor is snow, growing efficiently by vapour deposition. In contrast, the results of IOP 2A show a much deeper system in which graupel and its associated growth modes play an important role. These results are consistent with the two conceptual models of orographic rain that were derived from the MAP radar observations. Copyright ? 2006 Royal Meteorological Society},

Solid precipitation is particularly difficult to measure accurately, and wintertime precipitation measurement biases between different observing networks or different regions can exceed 100 \%. Using precipitation gauge results from the World Meteorological Organization Solid Precipitation Intercomparison Experiment (WMO-SPICE), errors in precipitation measurement caused by gauge uncertainty, spatial variability in precipitation, hydrometeor type, crystal habit, and wind were quantified. The methods used to calculate gauge catch efficiency and correct known biases are described. Adjustments, in the form of transfer functions that describe catch efficiency as a function of air temperature and wind speed, were derived using measurements from eight separate WMO-SPICE sites for both unshielded and single-Alter-shielded precipitation-weighing gauges. For the unshielded gauges, the average undercatch for all eight sites was 0.50 mm h−1 (34 \%), and for the single-Alter-shielded gauges it was 0.35 mm h−1 (24 \%). After adjustment, the mean bias for both the unshielded and single-Alter measurements was within 0.03 mm h−1 (2 \%) of zero. The use of multiple sites to derive such adjustments makes these results unique and more broadly applicable to other sites with various climatic conditions. In addition, errors associated with the use of a single transfer function to correct gauge undercatch at multiple sites were estimated.},

In this study, we assess the capabilities of deterministic and probabilistic cool-season quantitative precipitation forecasts (QPFs) produced by the 10-member, convection-permitting (3-km horizontal grid spacing) NCAR Ensemble using observations collected by SNOTEL stations at mountain locations across the western United States and precipitation analyses from PRISM. We also examine the performance of operational forecast systems run by NCEP including the High Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) model, the NAM forecast system with a 3-km continental United States (CONUS) nest, GFS, and the Short-Range Ensemble Forecast system (SREF). Overall, we ﬁnd that higher-resolution models, such as the HRRR, NAM-3km CONUS nest, and an individual member of the NCAR Ensemble, are more deterministically skillful than coarser models, especially over the narrow interior ranges of the western United States, likely because they better resolve topography and thus better simulate orographic precipitation. The 10-member NCAR Ensemble is also more probabilistically skillful than 13-member subensembles composed of each SREF dynamical core, but less probabilistically skillful than the full 26-member SREF, as a result of insufﬁcient spread. These results should help guide future short-range model development and inform forecasters about the capabilities and limitations of several widely used deterministic and probabilistic modeling systems over the western United States.},

	abstract = {One predicted consequence of global warming is an increased frequency of extreme weather events, such as heat waves, droughts, or heavy rainfalls. In parts of the Arctic, extreme warm spells and heavy rain-on-snow (ROS) events in winter are already more frequent. How these weather events impact snow-pack and permafrost characteristics is rarely documented empirically, and the implications for wildlife and society are hence far from understood. Here we characterize and document the effects of an extreme warm spell and ROS event that occurred in High Arctic Svalbard in January–February 2012, during the polar night. In this normally cold semi-desert environment, we recorded above-zero temperatures (up to 7 °C) across the entire archipelago and record-breaking precipitation, with up to 98 mm rainfall in one day (return period of {\textgreater}500 years prior to this event) and 272 mm over the two-week long warm spell. These precipitation amounts are equivalent to 25 and 70\% respectively of the mean annual total precipitation. The extreme event caused significant increase in permafrost temperatures down to at least 5 m depth, induced slush avalanches with resultant damage to infrastructure, and left a significant ground-ice cover (∼5–20 cm thick basal ice). The ground-ice not only affected inhabitants by closing roads and airports as well as reducing mobility and thereby tourism income, but it also led to high starvation-induced mortality in all monitored populations of the wild reindeer by blocking access to the winter food source. Based on empirical-statistical downscaling of global climate models run under the moderate RCP4.5 emission scenario, we predict strong future warming with average mid-winter temperatures even approaching 0 °C, suggesting increased frequency of ROS. This will have far-reaching implications for Arctic ecosystems and societies through the changes in snow-pack and permafrost properties.},

In addition to the direct effects on climate—for example, on the frequency of heatwaves—this increase in surface temperatures has important consequences for the hydrological cycle, particularly in regions where water supply is currently dominated by melting snow or ice. In a warmer world, less winter precipitation falls as snow and the melting of winter snow occurs earlier in spring. Even without any changes in precipitation intensity, both of these effects lead to a shift in peak river runoff to winter and early spring, away from summer and autumn when demand is highest. Where storage capacities are not sufficient, much of the winter runoff will immediately be lost to the oceans. With more than one-sixth of the Earth's population relying on glaciers and seasonal snow packs for their water supply, the consequences of these hydrological changes for future water availability—predicted with high confidence and already diagnosed in some regions—are likely to be severe.},

A microphysical budget over the windward slope at 1.33-km horizontal grid spacing was calculated, in which the importance of each microphysical process was quantified relative to the water vapor loss (WVL) rate. Over the windward Cascades, the largest water vapor loss was associated with condensation (73\% of WVL) and snow deposition (24\%), and the windward surface precipitation resulted primarily from accretion of cloud water by rain (27\% of WVL), graupel fallout and melt (19\%), and snowmelt (6\%). Two-thirds of the snow generated aloft spilled over into the lee in an area of model overprediction, resulting in windward precipitation efficiency of only 50\%. Even with the large amount of precipitation spillover, the windward precipitation was still overpredicted in many locations. A series of experiments were completed using different snowfall speeds, cloud water autoconversion, threshold riming values for snow to graupel autoconversion, and slope intercepts for snow. The surface precipitation was most sensitive to those parameters associated with the snow size distribution and fall speed, while decreasing the riming threshold for snow to graupel conversion had the greatest positive impact on the precipitation forecast. All simulations overpredicted cloud water over the lower windward slopes, had too little cloud water over the crest, and had too much ice at moderate-to-large sizes aloft. Riming processes were important, since without supercooled water there were bull’s-eyes of spurious snow spillover over the lee slopes.},

The MM5 correctly replicated the extent of the snow field and the growth of snow particles by vapor deposition measured along aircraft flight tracks between altitudes of 4.9 and 6 km, but overpredicted the mass concentrations of snow. The model produced a broader number distribution of snow particles than observed, overpredicting the number of moderate-to-large-sized snow particles and underpredicting the number of small particles observed along the aircraft flight track. Over the mountain crest, the model overpredicted depositional growth of snow and mass concentrations of snow, but underpredicted the amount of cloud liquid water and conversion of snow to graupel. The misclassification of graupel as snow and excessive amounts of snow resulted in the model overpredicting precipitation on the lee slopes and in localized areas along the foothills of the Cascades. The model overpredicted cloud liquid water over the lower windward slopes and foothills, where accretion of cloud liquid water by rain was the primary precipitation-producing mechanism.},

Rainfall forecasts were compared to gridded observations produced by National Weather Service River Forecast Centers and gauge measurements from the Community Collaborative Rain, Hail and Snow Network (CoCoRaHS). All 1-km forecasts produced 48-h rainfall exceeding 250 mm over portions of the Colorado Front Range and were more consistent with observations than the 4-km forecasts. While localized sensitivities to both ICs and MP were noted, systematic differences were not attributable to the varied ICs or MP schemes. At times, the 1-km forecasts produced precipitation structures similar to those observed, but none of the forecasts successfully captured the observed mesoscale evolution of the entire rainfall event. Nonetheless, as all 1-km forecasts produced torrential rainfall over the Colorado Front Range, these forecasts could have been useful guidance for this event.},

Eitherstate of a pair of analogues may be regarded as equal to the other state plus a small superposed "error."From the behavior of the atmosphere following each state, the growth rate of the error may be determined. Five years of twice-daily height values of the 200-, 500-, and 850-mb surfaces at a grid of 1003 pointsover the Northern Hemisphere are procured. A weighted root-mean-square height difference is used as ameasure of the difference between two states, or the error. For each pair of states occurring within onemonth of the same time of year, but in different years, the error is computed. There are numerous mediocre analogues but no truly good ones. The smallest errors have an averagedoubling time of about 8 days. Larger errors grow less rapidly. Extrapolation with the aid of a quadratichypothesis indicates that truly small errors would double in about 2.5 days. These rates may be comparedwith a 5-day doubling time previously deduced from dynamical considerations. The possibility that the computed growth rate is spurious, and results only from having superposedthe smaller errors on those particular states where errors grow most rapidly, is considered and rejected. Thelikelihood of encountering any truly good analogues by processing all existing upper-level data appearsto be small.},

We present results from an extreme rain-on-snow event that triggered a glide avalanche near Snoqualmie Pass, Washington, USA. Snoqualmie Pass recorded 463 cm of snowfall from 13 December 2008 to 6 January 2009. This period of snowfall was followed by a strong southwesterly tropical flow that resulted in an extreme rain-on-snow event. Sensors at Snoqualmie Pass recorded 285 mm of precipitation over a 52 hour period. Flooding, slush flows, landslides and avalanches resulted from the influx of precipitation. Snow heights decreased rapidly over the period, with settlement rates approaching 80 mm h−1. Liquid water infiltrated and flowed through the snowpack within a few hours of the arrival of rain, yet many of the major avalanches occurred 12–30 or more hours after the onset of rain and water outflow. A glide avalanche occurred ∼30 hours after the onset of rain and the establishment of drainage through the snowpack. Increasing glide rates correlate with periods of rapid snow settlement. Here glide rates approached 670 mm h−1. Although glide and settlement rates increased during periods of intense precipitation, glide failure occurred 8 hours after peak precipitation and outflow.},

	abstract = {Across the Arctic, heavy rain-on-snow (ROS) is an “extreme” climatic event that is expected to become increasingly frequent with global warming. This has potentially large ecosystem implications through changes in snowpack properties and ground-icing, which can block the access to herbivores' winter food and thereby suppress their population growth rates. However, the supporting empirical evidence for this is still limited. We monitored late winter snowpack properties to examine the causes and consequences of ground-icing in a Svalbard reindeer (Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus) metapopulation. In this high-arctic area, heavy ROS occurred annually, and ground-ice covered from 25\% to 96\% of low-altitude habitat in the sampling period (2000–2010). The extent of ground-icing increased with the annual number of days with heavy ROS (≥10 mm) and had a strong negative effect on reindeer population growth rates. Our results have important implications as a downscaled climate projection (2021–2050) suggests a substantial future increase in ROS and icing. The present study is the first to demonstrate empirically that warmer and wetter winter climate influences large herbivore population dynamics by generating ice-locked pastures. This may serve as an early warning of the importance of changes in winter climate and extreme weather events in arctic ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Falling snow is an important component of global precipitation in extratropical regions. This paper describes the methodology and results of physically based retrievals of snow falling over land surfaces. Because microwave brightness temperatures emitted by snow-covered surfaces are highly variable, precipitating snow above such surfaces is difficult to observe using window channels that occur at low frequencies (ν{\textless}100 GHz). Furthermore, at frequencies ν≤37 GHz, sensitivity to liquid hydrometeors is dominant. These problems are mitigated at high frequencies (ν{\textgreater}100 GHz) where water vapor screens the surface emission, and sensitivity to frozen hydrometeors is significant. However, the scattering effect of snowfall in the atmosphere at those higher frequencies is also impacted by water vapor in the upper atmosphere. The theory of scattering by randomly oriented dry snow particles at high microwave frequencies appears to be better described by regarding snow as a concatenation of "equivalent" ice spheres rather than as a sphere with the effective dielectric constant of an air-ice mixture. An equivalent sphere snow scattering model was validated against high-frequency attenuation measurements. Satellite-based high-frequency observations from an Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU-B) instrument during the March 5-6, 2001 New England blizzard were used to retrieve snowfall over land. Vertical distributions of snow, temperature, and relative humidity profiles were derived from the Mesoscale Model (MM5) cloud model. Those data were applied and modified in a radiative transfer model that derived brightness temperatures consistent with the AMSU-B observations. The retrieved snowfall distribution was validated with radar reflectivity measurements obtained from a ground-based radar network.},

	abstract = {A snowfall retrieval algorithm based on Bayes' theorem is developed using high-frequency microwave satellite data. In this algorithm, observational data from both airborne and surface-based radars are used to construct an a priori database of snowfall profiles. These profiles are then used as input to a forward radiative transfer model to obtain brightness temperatures at high microwave frequencies. In the radiative transfer calculations, two size distributions for snowflakes and ten observed atmospheric sounding profiles are used with snowfall profiles from observations. In addition, the scattering properties of the snowflakes are calculated on the basis of realistic nonspherical shapes using discrete dipole approximation. The algorithm is first verified by airborne microwave and radar observations and then applied to the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-B (AMSU-B) satellite data. The retrieved snowfall rates using AMSU-B data from three snowfall cases in the vicinity of Japan show reasonable agreement with surface radar observations with correlation coefficients of about 0.8, 0.6, and 0.96 for the three cases, respectively. The comparison results also suggest the algorithm performs better for dry and heavy snow cases, but is less accurate for wet and weak snow cases.},

	abstract = {Ground-based vertically pointing and airborne/spaceborne nadir-pointing millimeter-wavelength radars are being increasingly used worldwide. Though such radars are primarily designed for cloud remote sensing, they can also be used for precipitation measurements including snowfall estimates. In this study, modeling of snowfall radar properties is performed for the common frequencies of millimeter-wavelength radars such as those used by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program (Ka and W bands) and the CloudSat mission (W band). Realistic snowflake models including aggregates and single dendrite crystals were used. The model input included appropriate mass–size and terminal fall velocity–size relations and snowflake orientation and shape assumptions. It was shown that unlike in the Rayleigh scattering regime, which is often applicable for longer radar wavelengths, the spherical model does not generally satisfactorily describe scattering of larger snowflakes at millimeter wavelengths. This is especially true when, due to aerodynamic forcing, these snowflakes are oriented primarily with their major dimensions in the horizontal plane and the zenith/nadir radar pointing geometry is used. As a result of modeling using the experimental snowflake size distributions, radar reflectivity–liquid equivalent snowfall rates (Ze–S) relations are suggested for “dry” snowfalls that consist of mostly unrimed snowflakes containing negligible amounts of liquid water. Owing to uncertainties in the model assumptions, these relations, which are derived for the common Ka- and W-band radar frequencies, have significant variability in their coefficients that can exceed a factor of 2 or so. Modeling snowfall attenuation suggests that the attenuation effects in “dry” snowfall can be neglected at the Ka band for most practical cases, while at the W band attenuation may need to be accounted for in heavier snowfalls observed at longer ranges.},

	abstract = {Climate models predict Antarctic precipitation to increase during the 21st century, but their present day Antarctic precipitation differs. A model-independent climatology of the Antarctic precipitation characteristics, such as snowfall rates and frequency, is needed to assess the models, but it is not yet available. Satellite observations of precipitation by active sensors has been possible in the polar regions since the launch of CloudSat in 2006. Here, we use two CloudSat products to generate the first multi-year, model-independent climatology of Antarctic precipitation. The first product is used to determine the frequency and the phase of precipitation, while the second product is used to assess the snowfall rate. The mean snowfall rate from August 2006 to April 2011 is 171 mm year−1 over the Antarctic ice sheet, north of 82° S. While uncertainties on individual precipitation retrievals from CloudSat data are potentially large, the mean uncertainty should be much smaller, but cannot be easily estimated. There are no in situ measurements of Antarctic precipitation to directly assess the new climatology. However, distributions of both precipitation occurrences and rates generally agree with the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ERA-Interim data set, the production of which is constrained by various in situ and satellite observations, but does not use any data from CloudSat. The new data set thus offers unprecedented capability to quantitatively assess Antarctic precipitation statistics and rates in climate models.},

CloudSat snowfall observations and snowfall rate estimates from the CloudSat 2C-Snow Water Content and Snowfall Rate (2C-SNOW-PROFILE) product are partitioned between shallow cumuliform and nimbostratus cloud structures by utilizing coincident cloud category classifications from the CloudSat 2B-Cloud Scenario Classification (2B-CLDCLASS) product. Shallow cumuliform (nimbostratus) snowfall events comprise about 36\% (59\%) of snowfall events in the CloudSat snowfall dataset. The remaining 5\% of snowfall events are distributed between other categories. Distinct oceanic versus continental trends exist between the two major snowfall categories, as shallow cumuliform snow-producing clouds occur predominantly over the oceans. Regional differences are also noted in the partitioned dataset, with over-ocean regions near Greenland, the far North Atlantic Ocean, the Barents Sea, the western Pacific Ocean, the southern Bering Sea, and the Southern Hemispheric pan-oceanic region containing distinct shallow snowfall occurrence maxima exceeding 60\%. Certain Northern Hemispheric continental regions also experience frequent shallow cumuliform snowfall events (e.g., inland Russia), as well as some mountainous regions. CloudSat-generated snowfall rates are also partitioned between the two major snowfall categories to illustrate the importance of shallow snow-producing cloud structures to the average annual snowfall. While shallow cumuliform snowfall produces over 50\% of the annual estimated surface snowfall flux regionally, about 18\% (82\%) of global snowfall is attributed to shallow (nimbostratus) snowfall. This foundational spaceborne snowfall study will be utilized for follow-on evaluative studies with independent model, reanalysis, and ground-based observational datasets to characterize respective dataset biases and to better quantify CloudSat snowfall detection and quantitative snowfall estimate uncertainties.},

	abstract = {This work investigates the link between the most extreme daily precipitation (EDP) events observed since 1900 on the west coast of Norway and the large-scale moisture fluxes over the North Atlantic Ocean. Using station precipitation data, vertically integrated water vapor (IWV) from Special Sensors Microwave Imager/Sounder (SSMIS) satellite observations and the state of the art NOAA-twentieth Century (NOAA-20C) reanalysis, it is shown that 55 out of 58 EDPs are associated with narrow plumes of intense low-level moisture defined as atmospheric rivers. Despite the high spatial correlation between IWV fields in the SSMIS and NOAA-20C data sets, the significant positive relationship between the maximum amount of observed precipitation at all stations and the IWV content hitting the coastal terrain is only observed in the SSMIS data set. Further, the composite analyses of synoptic conditions show that the preferred circulation type consists of a mean sea level pressure (MSLP) dipole pattern where a high-pressure system over central Europe and a series of low-pressure systems to the east of Iceland and over the Norwegian Sea are present. The west coast of Norway is located in the exit region of the anticyclonically curved upper tropospheric polar jet stream implying that the coupling of upper troposphere and surface dynamics begins to weaken at the time of EDPs. It is also found that the primary synoptic-scale precursors are persistent positive 500 hPa height geopotential and MSLP anomalies over central Europe up to 10 days before the occurrence of EDP events.},

	abstract = {The relationship between the North Atlantic oscillation (NAO) and winter temperature and precipitation over northern Europe has long been known. However, its strength is variable within this region. In this paper, an analysis of the regional variability of the influence of the NAO on winter precipitation in northern Europe is developed using empirical orthogonal function analysis, cluster analysis and simple correlation. Results show that precipitation in most of the region studied is affected by the NAO, although with varying intensity. The NAO strongly influences winter precipitation along the Norwegian coast, in northern Sweden and in southern Finland. It is evident that the region on the lee side of the Scandes (the mountain chain between Norway and Sweden) is protected from the effects of the moist western winds from the Atlantic that, in turn, are strongly related to the NAO. As a result, precipitation in this shielded area is mainly related to southeasterly winds. Copyright © 2003 Royal Meteorological Society},

An evaluation of the atmospheric moisture budget reveals coherent large-scale changes since 1980 that are linked to recent dry conditions over southern Europe and the Mediterranean, whereas northern Europe and parts of Scandinavia have generally experienced wetter than normal conditions.},

Examples are given of the structure of jet streams and planetary-scale tropopause folds, the propagation of a high-amplitude Rossby wave packet partway around a hemisphere, several subtropical wave breaking events, the similarities between exceptional cases of rapid cyclogenesis, favorable regions for cross-equatorial propagation of Rossby waves, the annual cycle of the tropical tropopause, the structure of the Tibetan anticyclone and equatorial easterly jet associated with the Asian monsoon, the meridional structure of the upper branch of the Hadley cell, the interaction of a hurricane and midlatitude trough to form the “Perfect Storm,” and the upper-tropospheric PV changes associated with El Niño and La Niña. Plumes of anticyclonic potential vorticity are frequently seen to be pulled from the subtropical reservoir and roll up into large anticyclones. These previously undescribed plumes may be particularly relevant to jet streak dynamics and stratosphere-troposphere exchange.},

The robustness of these well-tested and documented models will make it tempting for many to consider them as turn-key systems that can be used without any experience or formal training in numerical weather prediction. This paper is intended as a tutorial and caution for such prospective model users, with the specific purpose of illustrating that, in spite of advanced physical-process parameterizations and high resolutions permitted by faster computers, and modern mesoscale data for initial conditions, there is still a basic limitation to predictability with a LAM—lateral boundary conditions (LBC). Illustrations are provided of previous work that show the serious negative effects of LBCs, and guidelines are provided for helping to minimize their negative impact on forecast quality.},

	abstract = {The combined use of the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) high-resolution operational model, at T213 spectral triangular truncation and with 31 vertical levels (T213L31), and the Ensemble Prediction System (EPS), during cases of intense Mediterranean storms, is studied. In particular, it is discussed how EPS products can be used to provide a measure of confidence in the high-resolution precipitation forecast. Three case studies (two extreme events plus one false-alarm case) are analysed. The first event took place between 21 and 22 October 1994 over Greece, where heavy rainfall led to local flash-floods in many areas that cost the loss of 12 lives, and caused significant property damage. The second event occurred in northwest Italy (and some parts of southern France) exactly two weeks later. More than 60 lives were lost and the cost of damage was enormous. For both these cases, the EPS probability values for precipitation occurrence supported the medium-range T213L31 prediction, which proved to be successful. A third case is also investigated, where the high-resolution forecast suggested heavy rainfall over northern Italy but was not supported by the EPS. The T213L31 prediction for this case was poor. Finally, the reliability of EPS probability predictions is discussed. It is shown that probability forecasts of low-level temperature and wind show considerable skill. Reliability statistics of clusters of large-scale flow show considerable skill as well. Probabilistic precipitation predictions are less skilful, possibly due to the EPS model resolution.},

	abstract = {The forecast skill of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Ensemble Prediction System (EPS) in predicting precipitation probabilities is discussed. Four seasons are analyzed in detail using signal detection theory and reliability diagrams to define objective measure of predictive skill. First, the EPS performance during summer 1997 is discussed. Attention is focused on Europe and two European local regions, one centered around the Alps and the other around Ireland. Results indicate that for Europe the EPS can give skillful prediction of low precipitation amounts [i.e., lower than 2 mm (12 h)−1] up to forecast day 6, and of high precipitation amounts [i.e., between 2 and 10 mm (12 h)−1] up to day 4. Lower levels of skill are achieved for smaller local areas. Then, the EPS performance during summer 1996 (i.e., prior to the enhancement introduced on 10 December 1996 from 33 to 51 members and to resolution increase from T63 L19 to TL159 L31) and summer 1997 are compared. Results show that the EPS has been remarkably more skillful during summer 1997 than summer 1996, with the gain in predictability up to 3 days for the highest [5 and 10 mm (12 h)−1] amounts of precipitation. Finally, the EPS performance during wintertime is analyzed. Two issues are investigated: the seasonal variability of the forecast skill of the new EPS, and the impact of the system upgrade on the wintertime performance. The comparison of the performance of the new EPS system during winter 1996/97 and during summer 1997 indicates that the EPS is more skillful during winter than during summer, with differences in predictive skill around 3 days for precipitation amounts larger than 2 mm (12 h)−1. The comparison of the EPS performance before and after the system upgrade on 10 December 1996 during winter confirms the summer conclusion that the upgraded system is more skillful than the old one.},
