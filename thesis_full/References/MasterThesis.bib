	abstract = {Estimates of snowfall rate as derived from radar reflectivities alone are non-unique. Different combinations of snowflake microphysical properties and particle fall speeds can conspire to produce nearly identical snowfall rates for given radar reflectivity signatures. Such ambiguities can result in retrieval uncertainties on the order of 100–200 \% for individual events. Here, we use observations of particle size distribution (PSD), fall speed, and snowflake habit from the Multi-Angle Snowflake Camera (MASC) to constrain estimates of snowfall derived from Ka-band ARM zenith radar (KAZR) measurements at the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) North Slope Alaska (NSA) Climate Research Facility site at Barrow. MASC measurements of microphysical properties with uncertainties are introduced into a modified form of the optimal-estimation CloudSat snowfall algorithm (2C-SNOW-PROFILE) via the a priori guess and variance terms. Use of the MASC fall speed, MASC PSD, and CloudSat snow particle model as base assumptions resulted in retrieved total accumulations with a −18 \% difference relative to nearby National Weather Service (NWS) observations over five snow events. The average error was 36 \% for the individual events. Use of different but reasonable combinations of retrieval assumptions resulted in estimated snowfall accumulations with differences ranging from −64 to +122 \% for the same storm events. Retrieved snowfall rates were particularly sensitive to assumed fall speed and habit, suggesting that in situ measurements can help to constrain key snowfall retrieval uncertainties. More accurate knowledge of these properties dependent upon location and meteorological conditions should help refine and improve ground- and space-based radar estimates of snowfall.},

The focus is on the "golden sample" case study for this type of analysis based on observations collected during the deployment of the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program's (ARM) mobile facility AMF2 at Hyytiälä, Finland, during the Biogenic Aerosols – Effects on Clouds and Climate (BAECC) field campaign. The presented analysis of the height evolution of the radar Doppler spectra is a state-of-the-art retrieval with profiling cloud radars in SLW layers beyond the traditional use of spectral moments. Dynamical effects are considered by following the particle population evolution along slanted tracks that are caused by horizontal advection of the cloud under wind shear conditions. In the SLW layer, the identified liquid peak is used as an air motion tracer to correct the Doppler spectra for vertical air motion and the ice peak is used to study the radar profiles of rimed particles. A 1-D steady-state bin microphysical model is constrained using the SLW and air motion profiles and cloud top radar observations. The observed radar moment profiles of the rimed snow can be simulated reasonably well by the model, but not without making several assumptions about the ice particle concentration and the relative role of deposition and aggregation. This suggests that in situ observations of key ice properties are needed to complement the profiling radar observations before process-oriented studies can effectively evaluate ice microphysical parameterizations.},

Precipitation measurements have a well-documented and mostly wind-dependent bias which is especially apparent during solid precipitation events. The resulting inaccuracy in precipitation data remains an area of concern in quantifying regional and global climate trends. As a high-latitude country, Norway has many solid precipitation events often accompanied by high wind speeds where the current adjustment functions have only limited validity. The presented study aims at improving the quality of solid precipitation data. In a comprehensive field experiment, precipitation data of standard automatic gauges are compared with data of a reference gauge surrounded by a double fence construction to minimize wind impact. Additional meteorological parameters are measured at the test site, allowing for an in-depth analysis of high-temporal-resolution precipitation data. The goal is to develop new adjustment functions for solid precipitation measurements which account for Norway's typical climate and are suitable for automated measurements. Measurements began in winter 2010/2011 at the alpine test site in southern Norway (chosen after a pre-study in 2009/2010) and will continue for two more winters. In this paper, the test site and its instrumentation are described and preliminary results are presented.},

A detailed study is presented which shows that the cloud optical thickness (τc) and effective particle radius (re) of water clouds can be determined solely from reflection function measurements at 0.75 and 2.16 μm, provided τc ≳ 4 and re ≳ 6 μm. For optically thin clouds the retrieval becomes ambiguous, resulting in two possible solutions for the effective radius and optical thickness. Adding a third channel near 1.65 μm does not improve the situation noticeably, whereas the addition of a channel near 3.70 μm reduces the ambiguity in deriving the effective radius. The effective radius determined by the above procedure corresponds to the droplet radius at some optical depth within the cloud layer. For clouds having τc ≳ 8, the effective radius determined using the 0.75 and 2.16 μm channels can be regarded as 85\%–95\% of the radius at cloud top, which corresponds in turn to an optical depth 20\%–40\% of the total optical thickness of the cloud layer.},

	abstract = {A method of remotely sensing integrated cloud liquid water over the oceans using spaceborne passive measurements from the special sensor microwave/imager (SSM/I) is described. The technique is comprised of a simple physical model that uses the 19.35- and 37-GHz channels of the SSM/I. The most comprehensive validation to date of cloud liquid water estimated from satellites is presented. This is accomplished through a comparison to independent ground-based microwave radiometer measurements of liquid water on San Nicolas Island, over the North Sea, and on Kwajalein and Saipan Islands in the western Pacific. In areas of marine stratocumulus clouds off the coast of California a further comparison is made to liquid water inferred from advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) visible reflectance measurements. The results are also compared qualitatively with near-coincident satellite imagery and with other existing microwave methods in selected regions. These comparisons indicate that the liquid water amounts derived from the simple scheme are consistent with the ground-based measurements for nonprecipitating cloud systems in the subtropics and middle to high latitudes. The comparison in the tropics, however, was less conclusive. Nevertheless, the retrieval method appears to have general applicability over most areas of the global oceans. An observational measure of the minimum uncertainty in the retrievals is determined in a limited number of known cloud-free areas, where the liquid water amounts are found to have a low variability of 0.016 kg m−2. A simple sensitivity and error analysis suggests that the liquid water estimates have a theoretical relative error typically ranging from about 25\% to near 40\% depending on the atmospheric/surface conditions and on the amount of liquid water present in the cloud. For the global oceans as a whole the average cloud liquid water is determined to be about 0.08 kg m−2. The major conclusion of this paper is that reasonably accurate amounts of cloud liquid water can be retrieved from SSM/I observations for nonprecipitating cloud systems, particularly in areas of persistent stratocumulus clouds, with less accurate retrievals in tropical regions.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces a radiative transfer model for the 9.6-μm ozone band that specifically matches the TIROS operational vertical sounder (TOVS) channel 9. The model is based on a spectral Malkmus band model for transmission. Band parameters were calculated by comparing to MODTRAN3 derived radiances. The effect of pressure on absorption is dealt with using a four-parameter approximation, and the improvements of this approximation over the more common Van de Hulst-Curtis-Godson scaling approximation are assessed. While this new model is exploited in the development of the retrieval described in this paper, the result has wider applicability to ozone climate problems requiring calculation of the radiative forcing associated with changing ozone. A two-layer version of the radiative transfer model is implemented in a retrieval scheme to obtain total ozone amounts from radiances measured by the TOVS instrument. Because the TOVS ozone channel is mainly sensitive to lower stratospheric ozone, ozone columns of the upper layer (above 30 hPa and with mean pressure of 10 hPa) are prescribed as a function of latitude. Ozone columns of the lower layer (mean pressure of 105 hPa) are then retrieved. The retrieval is based on a nonlinear optimal estimation algorithm and provides definition of error characteristics for every retrieval, which makes it possible to obtain a spatial distribution of the errors in the retrieval together with the spatial distribution of the retrieved total ozone column itself. This global distribution of the retrieval error and also of the contribution of a priori knowledge to the retrieval is presented to provide a validity of the ozone retrievals. Total ozone mapping spectrometer (TOMS) statistics are used as a priori information in the retrieval, and the 40-layer model is used to estimate the forward model error of the two-layer model. Comparisons of ozone retrievals for 1989 with TOMS total ozone measurements show good agreement both in time and in space with a rms difference between 1\% and 3\% for zonal means and 10\% for global gridded measurements.},

	abstract = {A new method for retrieving rainfall profiles from a spaceborne radar is introduced. As a result of the frequencies necessary in spaceborne radar applications, attenuation by both rainfall and liquid cloud particles is nonnegligible and must be accurately accounted for before quantitative rainfall estimates can be made. The proposed method is based on the minimization of a cost function that allows one to account for attenuation at each level directly in the iteration process. In addition, the algorithm does not invoke the Rayleigh approximation and is, therefore, applicable at wavelengths characteristic of spaceborne radars. The method is flexible with regard to the parameters to be retrieved and is well-suited for the addition of measurements from other sensors, such as a passive microwave radiometer, to constrain the retrieval. Preliminary results, using simplified assumptions of drop size distribution and particle shape, illustrate the utility of the algorithm provided the attenuation is not severe. At the frequency of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) precipitation radar (14 GHz), synthetic retrievals are accurate to within 20\% for rain rates up to 40 mm h−1. On the other hand, at 94 GHz, the frequency of the CloudSat cloud profiling radar, attenuation effects are too severe at rain rates greater than 1.5 mm h−1, suggesting the need for additional information to constrain the retrieval. Such information might come in the form of a path-integrated attenuation (PIA) derived from surface echo measurements or, alternatively, a precipitation water path (PWP) estimate from a passive microwave radiometer. Addition of a simple PWP constraint yields improvements in the retrieved rainfall profiles from both instruments when attenuation is severe. At 94 GHz, in particular, it is found that accurate quantitative rainfall estimates can be made provided the near-surface rain rate does not exceed 10 mm h−1.},

	abstract = {Cirrus clouds have a profound impact on the radiation balance of the Earth–atmosphere system. Accurate representation of their radiative properties is critical to understanding climate and predicting climate change. This paper casts the split-window cirrus cloud retrieval technique in an optimal estimation framework facilitating direct inclusion of explicit cloud boundary information from complementary sensors as well as providing a suite of diagnostic tools for evaluating the dominant sources of uncertainty in all retrieved quantities. Errors in retrieved microphysical properties are used to determine the resulting errors in the calculation of global-scale radiative budgets. Uncertainties in optical depth and effective radius are found to diminish from ∼45\% and ∼80\%, respectively, in the absence of explicit cloud boundary information to ∼15\% and ∼60\% when accurate radar-based or lidar-based estimates are included. It is demonstrated that the improvements to cirrus cloud optical properties afforded by accurate cloud boundary information may lead to as much as a factor of 3 increase in the accuracy to which their impact on the Earth's radiative balance can be modeled. Colocated infrared radiances from the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument aboard the Earth Observing System (EOS) Aqua satellite and cloud radar observations from the CloudSat satellite will soon allow the retrieval presented here to be integrated into an operational retrieval of the vertical distribution of cloud properties on a global scale.},

	abstract = {The authors investigate whether radar remote sensing of a certain class of ice clouds allows for characterization of the precipitation rates and aggregation processes. The NASA DC-8 collected the measurements in tropical anvils during July and August 2007 as part of the Tropical Composition, Cloud and Climate Coupling (TC4) experiment. Measured hydrometeor size distributions are used to estimate precipitation rates (P) and to solve the hydrodynamical collection equation. These distributions are also used to estimate radar reflectivity factors (Z) and Doppler velocities (Vd) at W, Ka, and Ku bands. Optimal estimation techniques are then used to estimate the uncertainty in retrieving P and aggregation rates (A) from combinations of Z and Vd. It is found that diagnosing information about A requires significant averaging and that a dual-frequency combination of W and Ka bands seems to provide the most information for the ice clouds sampled during TC4. Furthermore, the addition of Vd with expected uncertainty contributes little to the microphysical retrieval of either P or A. It is also shown that accounting for uncertainty in ice microphysical bulk density dominates the retrieval uncertainty in both P and A causing, for instance, the instantaneous uncertainty in retrieved P to increase from {\textasciitilde}30\% to {\textasciitilde}200\%.},

	abstract = {On average, the models in the Fifth Climate Model Intercomparison Project archive predict an increase in Antarctic precipitation from 5.5 to 24.5 \% between 1986–2005 and 2080–2099, depending on greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. This translates into a moderation of future sea level rise ranging from −19 to −71 mm between 2006 and 2099. However, comparison with CloudSat and ERA-Interim data show that almost all the models overestimate current Antarctic precipitation, some by more than 100 \%. If only the models that agree with CloudSat data within 20 \% of error are considered, larger precipitation changes (from 7.4 to 29.3 \%) and impact on sea level (from −25 to −85 mm) are predicted. A common practice of averaging all models to evaluate climate projections thus leads to a significant underestimation of the contribution of Antarctic precipitation to future sea level. Models simulate, on average, a 7.4 \%/°C precipitation change with surface temperature warming. The models in better agreement with CloudSat observations for Antarctic snowfall predict, on average, larger temperature and Antarctic sea ice cover changes, which could explain the larger changes in Antarctic precipitation simulated by these models. The agreement between the models, CloudSat data and ERA-Interim is generally less in the interior of Antarctica than at the peripheries, but the interior is also where climate change will induce the smallest absolute change in precipitation. About three-quarters of the impact on sea level will result from precipitation change over the half most peripheral and lowest elevation part of the surface of Antarctica.},

	abstract = {Accurate snowfall estimates are important for both weather and climate applications. Ground-based weather radars and space-based satellite sensors are often used as viable alternatives to rain gauges to estimate precipitation in this context. In particular, the Cloud Profiling Radar (CPR) on board CloudSat is proving to be a useful tool to map snowfall globally, in part due to its high sensitivity to light precipitation and its ability to provide near-global vertical structure. CloudSat snowfall estimates play a particularly important role in the high-latitude regions as other ground-based observations become sparse and passive satellite sensors suffer from inherent limitations. In this paper, snowfall estimates from two observing systems – Swerad, the Swedish national weather radar network, and CloudSat – are compared. Swerad offers a well-calibrated data set of precipitation rates with high spatial and temporal resolution, at very high latitudes. The measurements are anchored to rain gauges and provide valuable insights into the usefulness of CloudSat CPR's snowfall estimates in the polar regions. In total, 7.2 × 105 matchups of CloudSat and Swerad observations from 2008 through 2010 were intercompared, covering all but the summer months (June to September). The intercomparison shows encouraging agreement between the two observing systems despite their different sensitivities and user applications. The best agreement is observed when CloudSat passes close to a Swerad station (46–82 km), where the observational conditions for both systems are comparable. Larger disagreements outside this range suggest that both platforms have difficulty with shallow snow but for different reasons. The correlation between Swerad and CloudSat degrades with increasing distance from the nearest Swerad station, as Swerad's sensitivity decreases as a function of distance. Swerad also tends to overshoot low-level precipitating systems further away from the station, leading to an underestimation of snowfall rate and occasionally to missing precipitation altogether. Several statistical metrics – including the probability of detection, false alarm rate, hit rate, and Pierce's skill score – are calculated. The sensitivity of these metrics to the snowfall rate, as well as to the distance from the nearest radar station, are summarised. This highlights the strengths and the limitations of both observing systems at the lower and upper ends of the snowfall distributions as well as the range of uncertainties that can be expected from these systems in high-latitude regions.},

	abstract = {A new method to automatically classify solid hydrometeors based on Multi-Angle Snowflake Camera (MASC) images is presented. For each individual image, the method relies on the calculation of a set of geometric and texture-based descriptors to simultaneously identify the hydrometeor type (among six predefined classes), estimate the degree of riming and detect melting snow. The classification tasks are achieved by means of a regularized multinomial logistic regression (MLR) model trained over more than 3000 MASC images manually labeled by visual inspection. In a second step, the probabilistic information provided by the MLR is weighed on the three stereoscopic views of the MASC in order to assign a unique label to each hydrometeor. The accuracy and robustness of the proposed algorithm is evaluated on data collected in the Swiss Alps and in Antarctica. The algorithm achieves high performance, with a hydrometeor-type classification accuracy and Heidke skill score of 95 \% and 0.93, respectively. The degree of riming is evaluated by introducing a riming index ranging between zero (no riming) and one (graupel) and characterized by a probable error of 5.5 \%. A validation study is conducted through a comparison with an existing classification method based on two-dimensional video disdrometer (2DVD) data and shows that the two methods are consistent.},

Along with the joint modeling framework, AROME was implemented and utilized in both northern and southern European conditions by the above listed countries, and this activity has led to extensive updates to the model’s physical parameterizations. In this paper the authors present the differences in model dynamics and physical parameterizations compared with AROME, as well as important configuration choices of the reference, such as lateral boundary conditions, model levels, horizontal resolution, model time step, as well as topography, physiography, and aerosol databases used.

The simplest considerations of precipitation involve its vertical distribution in an updraft column, where condensate appears immediately as precipitation with uniform terminal fallspeed. The study also treats steady two-dimensional air circulations in which time-dependent distributions of water vapor, cloud and precipitation respond to model microphysical processes.The approach throughout is essentially kinematic, although results provide numerous insights into the dynamical properties of a cloudy or stormy atmosphere. Water distributions are explained in relation to the air’s horizontal divergence, vertical velocity and compressibility, and physical pictures are presented frequently.

	abstract = {Precipitation measurements exhibit large cold-season biases due to under-catch in windy conditions. These uncertainties affect water balance calculations, snowpack monitoring and calibration of remote sensing algorithms and land surface models. More accurate data would improve the ability to predict future changes in water resources and mountain hazards in snow-dominated regions.  In 2010, a comprehensive test site for precipitation measurements was established on a mountain plateau in southern Norway. Automatic precipitation gauge data are compared with data from a precipitation gauge in a Double Fence Intercomparison Reference (DFIR) wind shield construction which serves as the reference. A large number of other sensors are provided supporting data for relevant meteorological parameters.  In this paper, data from three winters are used to study and determine the wind-induced under-catch of solid precipitation. Qualitative analyses and Bayesian statistics are used to evaluate and objectively choose the model that best describes the data. A continuous adjustment function and its uncertainty are derived for measurements of all types of winter precipitation (from rain to dry snow). A regression analysis does not reveal any significant misspecifications for the adjustment function, but shows that the chosen model does not describe the regression noise optimally. The adjustment function is operationally usable because it is based only on data available at standard automatic weather stations.  The results show a non-linear relationship between under-catch and wind speed during winter precipitation events and there is a clear temperature dependency, mainly reflecting the precipitation type. The results allow, for the first time, derivation of an adjustment function based on measurements above 7 m s−1. This extended validity of the adjustment function shows a stabilization of the wind-induced precipitation loss for higher wind speeds.},

	abstract = {Although now over 100 years old, the classification of climate originally formulated by Wladimir Köppen and modified by his collaborators and successors, is still in widespread use. It is widely used in teaching school and undergraduate courses on climate. It is also still in regular use by researchers across a range of disciplines as a basis for climatic regionalisation of variables and for assessing the output of global climate models. Here we have produced a new global map of climate using the Köppen-Geiger system based on a large global data set of long-term monthly precipitation and temperature station time series. Climatic variables used in the Köppen-Geiger system were calculated at each station and interpolated between stations using a two-dimensional (latitude and longitude) thin-plate spline with tension onto a 0.1°×0.1° grid for each continent. We discuss some problems in dealing with sites that are not uniquely classified into one climate type by the Köppen-Geiger system and assess the outcomes on a continent by continent basis. Globally the most common climate type by land area is BWh (14.2\%, Hot desert) followed by Aw (11.5\%, Tropical savannah).

The CPR observations are converted to snowfall rates S using derived Ze–S relationships, which were created from backscatter cross sections of various nonspherical and spherical ice particle models. The CPR reflectivity histograms show that the dominant mode of global near-surface dry snowfall has extremely light reflectivity values (∼3–4 dBZe), and an estimated 94\% of all CPR dry snowfall observations are less than 10 dBZe. The average conditional global snowfall rate is calculated to be about 0.28 mm h−1, but is regionally highly variable as well as strongly sensitive to the ice particle model chosen. Further, ground clutter contamination is found in regions of complex terrain even when a vertical reflectivity continuity threshold is utilized. The potential of future multifrequency spaceborne radars is evaluated using proxy 35–13.6-GHz reflectivities and sensor specifications of the proposed Global Precipitation Measurement dual-frequency precipitation radar (DPR). It is estimated that because of its higher detectability threshold, only about 7\%–1\% of the near-surface radar reflectivity values and about 17\%–4\% of the total accumulation associated with global dry snowfall would be detected by a DPR-like instrument, but these results are very sensitive to the chosen ice particle model. These potential detection shortcomings can be partially mitigated by using snowfall-rate distributions derived by the CPR or other similar high-frequency active sensors.},

	abstract = {A Bayesian optimal estimation retrieval is used to determine probability density functions of snow microphysical parameters from ground-based observations taken during four snowfall events in southern Ontario, Canada. The retrieved variables include the parameters of power laws describing particle mass and horizontally projected area. The results reveal nontrivial correlations between mass and area parameters that were not apparent in prior studies. The observations provide information mainly about the mass coefficient , somewhat less information about the mass exponent  and the projected area coefficient , and minimal information about the projected area exponent . The expected values for retrieved mass power-law parameters  = 0.003 28 and  = 2.25 are consistent with those from several prior studies that looked at the mass of aggregate-like particles and precipitating ice aloft as functions of maximum particle dimension. Differences from other studies appear related to differences in the dimensions used to define particle size. The retrieval allows the analysis of relatively large volumes of continuous observations, greatly enhancing sampling relative to single-particle analyses. The retrieved properties are used to constrain 94-GHz (W band) radar scattering properties for a variety of snow particle shapes. Synthetic reflectivities calculated using these scattering properties and observed particle size distributions show that a branched, spatial aggregate-like particle produces good agreement with coincident observed W-band reflectivities. Uncertainties in the synthetic reflectivities, estimated by applying a simple error-propagation model, are substantial and are dominated by the uncertainties in  and .},

Representations of PV on isentropic or isobaric surfaces can be cumbersome, as analyses of several surfaces spanning the troposphere must be constructed to fully apprehend the complete PV distribution. Following a brief review of the relationship between PV and nearly balanced flows, it is demonstrated that the tropospheric PV has a simple distribution, and as a consequence, an analysis of potential temperature along the dynamic tropopause (here defined as a surface of constant PV) allows for a simple representation of the upper-tropospheric and lower-stratospheric PV. The construction and interpretation of these tropopause maps, which may be termed “isertelic” analyses of potential temperature, are described. In addition, techniques to construct dynamical representations of the lower-tropospheric PV and near-surface potential temperature, which complement these isertelic analyses, are also suggested. Case studies are presented to illustrate the utility of these techniques in diagnosing phenomena such as cyclogenesis, tropopause folds, the formation of an upper trough, and the effects of latent heat release on the upper and lower troposphere.},

	abstract = {The long-standing observational view of cyclogenesis involves an interaction between tropopause- and surface-based finite-amplitude disturbances. There are, however, instances where more than one upper-level disturbance contributes to low-level development. A subset of these events involves wave (or trough) merger, which has been defined as the amalgamation of two or more distinct 500-hPa vorticity maxima. An example of this phenomenon involving a case of very intense continental cyclogenesis (25–26 January 1978) over the eastern United States is selected to elucidate the origin and evolution of precursor disturbances, from the planetary scale to the mesoscale. The analysis of this event reveals that the two well-defined tropopause-based disturbances that contribute to cyclogenesis have distinctly different origins and are brought together by confluent planetary-scale flow. One of these disturbances originates over the western North Pacific Ocean 10 days prior to cyclogenesis and tracks eastward toward western North America. The other disturbance originates over Siberia, tracks over the North Pole, and then southward through central Canada. As the upper disturbances come together, a surface cyclone deepens 43 hPa in 24 h, reaching a minimum sea level pressure of 955 hPa over southern Ontario, and establishing all-time low sea level pressure records for a large portion of the Ohio Valley and southern Ontario. Wave merger in this case consists of a close approach of the two upper-level precursor vorticity centers, rather than an amalgamation. The upper-level disturbances are found to translate conservatively (in terms of potential vorticity) and to attain maximum amplitude prior to cyclogenesis. Both disturbances are highly anomalous, with the dynamic tropopause locally depressed to near 800 hPa. Diabatic effects appear to alter the upper-level disturbance that originated over the Pacific late in the life cycle of the cyclone. The surface response to the upper-level disturbances is a multiple-low-center configuration, with the main cyclone forming and deepening in relatively colder air behind a prominent preexisting depression. On the basis of this observation, the importance of surface precursor disturbances is questioned in cases characterized by strong upper-level dynamics. A highly amplified thermal wave accompanies the cyclone at the ground and tropopause. At the ground, the wave results from a large-scale rotation of preexisting arctic and coastal/warm frontal boundaries, which follow closely the tracks of the two upper-level disturbances. The main surface cyclone develops in the zone between these preexisting fronts. The tropopause thermal wave consists primarily of contributions from the highly localized precursors and, thus, cannot be viewed as the result of the nonlinear amplification of a wave or wave packet on a background potential temperature field. The foregoing results suggest a generalization of conceptual and theoretical models of cyclogenesis to include multiple upper-level precursor disturbances, a flexible upper boundary (tropopause), and “one way” baroclinic development in which upper-level disturbances attain maximum amplitude prior to surface cyclogenesis.},

	abstract = {The ability of CloudSat to detect precipitation in cold season cloud systems is examined using data from the Environment Canada C band weather radar at King City, Ontario. The factors complicating the comparison are the time mismatch, the differences in sensitivity, and the changes to the geometry of cross section with range from the ground radar, W band radar attenuation, and the effect of ground clutter. A total of 40 overpasses with precipitation were observed over the King City radar from September 2006 to April 2007. In about 14\% of the precipitation profiles, time mismatches were diagnosed. When these cases were removed, the skill scores of the CloudSat precipitation occurrence product were excellent. The most frequent cause of a false detection was an incorrect precipitation threshold in the algorithm. The most frequent cause of a miss in detection was ground clutter removal of valid echoes by the algorithm. Overall, the CloudSat algorithm handled the effect of attenuation very well. Improvement to the algorithm would arise from a better tuning of the precipitation threshold, a threshold of −10 dBZ instead of −18 dBZ being more appropriate for winter storms in the Great Lakes area, and more effective ground clutter filtering in the lowest four range bins of the CloudSat data. The methodology employed here and the 1456 verified precipitation profiles from CloudSat can serve as a framework for a test bed to evaluate precipitation products from CloudSat.},

Here, the authors use Interim European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Re-Analysis (ERA-Interim) data, Climate Prediction Center (CPC) precipitation analyses, and Snowpack Telemetry (SNOTEL) observations to describe the characteristics of cool-season (November–April) ARs over the western United States. It is shown that AR frequency and duration exhibit a maximum along the Oregon–Washington coast, a strong transition zone upwind (west) of and over the Cascade–Sierra ranges, and a broad minimum that extends from the “high” Sierra south of Lake Tahoe eastward across the central Great Basin and into the deep interior. East of the Cascade–Sierra ranges, AR frequency and duration are largest over the interior northwest, while AR duration is large compared to AR frequency over the interior southwest. The fractions of cool-season precipitation and top-decile 24-h precipitation events attributable to ARs are largest over and west of the Cascade–Sierra ranges. Farther east, these fractions are largest over the northwest and southwest interior, with distinctly different large-scale patterns and AR orientations enabling AR penetration into each of these regions. In contrast, AR-related precipitation over the Great Basin east of the high Sierra is rare. These results indicate that water vapor depletion over major topographic barriers is a key contributor to AR decay, with ARs playing a more prominent role in the inland precipitation climatology where lower or less continuous topography facilitates the inland penetration of ARs.},

	abstract = {One of the challenges that limit the amount of information that can be inferred from radar measurements of ice and mixed-phase precipitating clouds is the variability in ice mass within hydrometeors. The variable amount of ice mass within particles of a given size drives further variability in single-scattering properties that results in uncertainties of forward-modeled remote sensing quantities. Nonspherical ice-phase hydrometeors are often approximated as spheroids to simplify the calculation of single-scattering properties, yet offline calculations remain necessary to quantify these radiative properties as a function of size in discrete increments. In this paper, a simple scaling of the Clausius–Mossotti factor is used that allows for an approximation of the scattering and extinction cross sections for an arbitrary mass–dimensional power-law relationship of a nonspherical particle given a single T-matrix calculation. Using data collected by the University of Wyoming King Air in snow clouds over the Colorado Park Range, the uncertainty in forward-modeled radar reflectivity to assumptions regarding mass–dimensional relationships is examined. This is accomplished by taking advantage of independently measured condensed mass and particle size distributions to estimate the variability of the prefactor in the mass–dimensional power law. Then, calculating the partial derivative of the radar backscatter cross sections using the scaling relationships, an estimate is made of the statistical uncertainty in forward-modeled radar reflectivity. Uncertainties on the order of 4 dB are found in this term for the dataset considered.},

An SVI utilizes a video camera with sufficient frame rate, pixels, and shutter speed to record thousands of snowflake images. The camera housing and lighting produce little airflow distortion, so SVI data are quite representative of natural conditions, which is important for volumetric data products such as snowflake size distributions. Long-duration, unattended operation of an SVI is feasible because datalogging software provides data compression and the hardware can operate for months in harsh winter conditions. Details of SVI hardware and field operation are given. Snowflake size distributions (SSDs) from a storm near Boulder, Colorado, are computed. An SVI is an imaging system, so SVI data can be utilized to compute diverse data products for various applications. In this paper, the authors present visualizations of frozen particles (i.e., snowflake aggregates as well as individual crystals), which provide insight into the weather conditions such as temperature, humidity, and winds.},

Power functions describing the variation of mass and horizontally projected area with particle size and a parameter related to particle shape are retrieved from near-Rayleigh radar reflectivity, particle size distribution, snowfall rate, and size-resolved particle fall speeds. Algorithm performance is explored in the context of instruments deployed during the Canadian CloudSat CALIPSO Validation Project, but the algorithm is adaptable to other similar combinations of sensors. Critical estimates of observational and forward model uncertainties are developed and used to quantify the performance of the method using synthetic cases developed from actual observations of snow events. In addition to illustrating the technique, the results demonstrate that this combination of sensors provides useful constraints on the mass parameters and on the coefficient of the area power function but only weakly constrains the exponent of the area power function and the shape parameter. Information content metrics show that about two independent quantities are measured by the suite of observations and that the method is able to resolve about eight distinct realizations of the state vector containing the mass and area power function parameters. Alternate assumptions about observational and forward model uncertainties reveal that improved modeling of particle fall speeds could contribute substantial improvements to the performance of the method.},

	abstract = {This paper describes the results of analysis of over 825 000 profiles of millimeter-wave radar (MWR) reflectivities primarily collected by zenith-pointing surface radars observing tropical convection associated with various phases of activity of the large-scale tropical circulation. The data principally analyzed in this paper come from surface observations obtained at the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Manus site during active and break episodes of the Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO) and from observations collected from a shipborne radar during an active phase of the monsoon over the Indian Ocean during the Joint Air–Sea Monsoon Interaction Experiment. It was shown, for example, in a histogram regime analysis that the MWR data produce statistics on convection regimes similar in most respects to the analogous regime analysis of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission radar–radiometer observations. Attenuation of the surface MWRs by heavy precipitation, however, incorrectly shifts a small fraction of the deeper precipitation modes into the shallow modes of precipitation. The principal findings are the following. (i) The cloud and precipitation structures of the different convective regimes are largely identical regardless of the mode of synoptic forcing, that is, regardless of whether the convection occurred during an active phase of the MJO, a transition phase of the MJO, or in an active monsoon period. What changes between these synoptically forced modes of convection are the relative frequencies of occurrences of the different storm regimes. (ii) The cloud structures associated with the majority of cases of observed precipitation (ranging in occurrence from 45\% to 53\% of all precipitation profiles) were multilayered structures regardless of the mode of synoptic forcing. The predominant multilayered cloud mode was of higher-level cirrus of varying thickness overlying cumulus congestus–like convection. (iii) The majority of water accumulated (i.e., 53\%–63\%) over each of the periods assigned to the active monsoon (5 days of data), the active MJO (38 days of data), and the transition MJO (53 days of data) fell from these multiple-layered cloud systems. (iv) Solar transmittances reveal that significantly less sunlight (reductions of about 30\%–50\%) reaches the surface in the precipitating regimes than reaches the surface under drizzle and cloud-only conditions, suggesting that the optical thicknesses of precipitation-bearing clouds significantly exceeds those of nonprecipitating clouds.},

	abstract = {The need for measuring snowfall is driven by the roles snow plays providing freshwater resources and affecting climate. Snow accumulations are an important resource for ecological and human needs and in many areas appear vulnerable to climate change. Snow cover modifies surface heat fluxes over areas extensive enough to influence climate at regional and perhaps global scales. Seasonal runoff from snowmelt, along with over-ocean snowfall, contributes to freshening in the Arctic and high-latitude North Atlantic oceans. Yet much of the Earth's area for which snowfall plays such significant roles is not well-monitored by observations.
Radar reflectivity at 94 GHz is sensitive to scattering by snow particles and CloudSat, in a near-polar orbit, provides vertically resolved measurements of 94 GHz reflectivity at latitudes from 82 N to 82 S. While not global in areal coverage, CloudSat does provide observations sampled from regions where snowfall is the dominant form of precipitation and an important component of hydrologic processes. The work presented in this study seeks to exploit these observations by developing and assessing a physically-base snowfall retrieval which uses an explicit representation of snow microphysical properties.
As the reflectivity-based snowfall retrieval problem is significantly underconstrained, a priori information about snow microphysical properties is required. The approaches typically used to develop relations between reflectivity and snowfall rate, so-called Ze-S relations, require assumptions about particle properties such as mass, area, fallspeed, and shape. Limited information about the distributions of these properties makes difficult the characterization of how uncertainties in the properties influence uncertainties in the Ze-S relations.
To address this, the study proceeded in two parts. In the first, probability distributions for snow particle microphysical properties were assessed using optimal estimation applied to multi-sensor surface-based snow observations from a field campaign. Mass properties were moderately well determined by the observations, the area properties less so. The retrieval revealed nontrivial correlations between mass and area parameters not apparent in prior studies. Synthetic testing showed that the performance of the retrieval was hampered by uncertainties in the fallspeed forward model. The mass and area properties obtained from this retrieval were used to construct particle models including 94 GHz scattering properties for dry snow. These properties were insufficient to constrain scattering properties to match observed 94 GHz reflectivities. Vertical aspect ratio supplied a sufficient additional constraint.
In the second part, the CloudSat retrieval, designed to estimate vertical profiles of snow size distribution parameters from reflectivity profiles, was applied to measurements from the field campaign and from an orbit of CloudSat observations. Uncertainties in the mass and area microphysical properties, obtained from the first part of this study, were substantial contributors to the uncertainties in the retrieved snowfall rates. Snowfall rate fractional uncertainties were typically 140\% to 200\%. Accumulations of snowfall calculated from the retrieval results matched observed accumulations to within 13\%, however, when allowances were made for snowfall with properties likely inconsistent with the snow particle model. Information content metrics showed that the size distribution slope parameters were moderately to strongly constrained by the reflectivity observations, while the intercept parameters were determined primarily by the a priori constraints. Results from the CloudSat orbit demonstrated the ability of the CloudSat retrieval to represent a range of scene-dependent Ze-S relations.},

	abstract = {Using airborne data from several recent field projects, the authors have taken another look at the properties of exponential ice particle size distributions (PSDs) when the PSDs are broad. Two primary questions are addressed: for what ranges of ice water content (IWC) and equivalent radar reflectivity (Ze) do exponentials produce accurate estimates of these higher moments of the PSD, and why is there a lower limit to the value to the slope of exponential fits to PSD, λ, as has been found from airborne measurements? Earlier studies at temperatures primarily above −10°C have found that λ measured in snow during spiral descents through deep ice cloud layers decreases to about 9 cm−1 and then remains there. Several physical processes have been advanced to explain these observations. If reliable, the data could be used to improve retrieval of ice cloud properties through remote sensing and for cloud model representations of ice cloud microphysical properties. For data acquired from 2D probes, recent evidence indicates shattering of large ice particles ahead of, but attributable to, the probe’s sensing area, generating small crystals that the probe then senses. Shattered artifacts have been objectively removed from the data. Comparisons of size distributions before and after removal of suspected shattered particles suggest that the reported minimum may have been due to shattering and/or other instrument errors. The revised PSDs indicate that for λ {\textless} 40 cm−1, 0.1 g m−1 {\textless} IWC, and 5 dB {\textless} Ze, moments two (IWC) through four (Ze) of the PSD are dominated by particles larger than a few hundred microns. Analytical representations with more variables than exponentials (e.g., gamma PSD) are not required to accurately derive these moments from the PSD. In these situations, the intercept parameter of the exponential PSD, N0 ≈ 1 cm−4, is 5 to 30 times larger than assumed earlier.},

	abstract = {There has been so far no global estimate of snowfall. CloudSat has, for the first time, provided an opportunity for us to conduct such an estimate. The present study seizes this opportunity and attempts to investigate the global snowfall characteristics using its cloud radar observations. The retrieval methodology developed in this study includes two parts: first, determining whether a radar echo corresponds to snowfall (instead of rainfall), and second, converting radar reflectivity to snowfall rate. The first part is a snow?rain threshold based on multiyear land station and shipboard present weather reports, and the second part is based on backscatter computations of nonspherical ice particles and in situ measured particle size distributions. Using the above retrieval method, global CloudSat data over 1 year were analyzed. The results show the following. (1) In the Southern Hemisphere, there is an almost zonally orientated high snowfall zone centered around 60°S, where both snowfall frequency and rate are high. In the Northern Hemisphere, however, heavy/frequent snowfall areas are mostly locked to geographical locations. (2) Zonally and annually averaged snowfall rate has its maximum value around 2 mm d?1, which is about one third of the zonally averaged rainfall values found in the tropics, signifying the importance of snowfall in hydrological cycle. (3) Vertical profiles of snowfall rate have the greatest variability in the lowest levels. While near?surface snowfall rate generally increases with cloud top height, there seems to be two prevailing groups of clouds with very different growth rate of snowfall as cloud top height increases. (4) The characteristics of the vertical distribution of snowfall rate are quite similar for over?ocean and over?land snow clouds, except that over?land snow clouds seem to be somewhat shallower than those over ocean.},

	abstract = {An Introduction to Clouds provides a fundamental understanding of clouds, ranging from cloud microphysics to the large-scale impacts of clouds on climate. On the microscale, phase changes and ice nucleation are covered comprehensively, including aerosol particles and thermodynamics relevant for the formation of clouds and precipitation. At larger scales, cloud dynamics, mid-latitude storms and tropical cyclones are discussed leading to the role of clouds on the hydrological cycle and climate. Each chapter ends with problem sets and multiple-choice questions that can be completed online, and important equations are highlighted in boxes for ease of reference. Combining mathematical formulations with qualitative explanations of underlying concepts, this accessible book requires relatively little previous knowledge, making it ideal for advanced undergraduate and graduate students in atmospheric science, environmental sciences and related disciplines.},

	abstract = {Clouds affect our daily weather and play key roles in the global climate. Through their ability to precipitate, clouds provide virtually all of the fresh water on Earth and are a crucial link in the hydrologic cycle. With ever-increasing importance being placed on quantifiable predictions – from forecasting the local weather to anticipating climate change – we must understand how clouds operate in the real atmosphere, where interactions with natural and anthropogenic pollutants are common. This textbook provides students – whether seasoned or new to the atmospheric sciences – with a quantitative yet approachable path to learning the inner workings of clouds. Developed over many years of the authors' teaching at Pennsylvania State University, Physics and Chemistry of Clouds is an invaluable textbook for advanced students in atmospheric science, meteorology, environmental sciences/engineering and atmospheric chemistry. It is also a very useful reference text for researchers and professionals.},

This book treats comprehensively the inverse problem of remote sounding, and discusses a wide range of retrieval methods for extracting atmospheric parameters of interest from the quantities (thermal emission, for example) that can be measured remotely. Inverse theory is treated in depth from an estimation-theory point of view, but practical questions are also emphasized, such as designing observing systems to obtain the maximum quantity of information, efficient numerical implementation of algorithms for processing large quantities of data, error analysis and approaches to the validation of the resulting retrievals. The book is targeted at graduate students as well as scientists.},

This paper presents the main characteristics of this new numerical weather prediction system: the nonhydrostatic dynamical model core, detailed moist physics, and the associated three-dimensional variational data assimilation (3D-Var) scheme. Dynamics options settings and variables are explained. The physical parameterizations are depicted as well as their mutual interactions. The scale-specific features of the 3D-Var scheme are shown. The performance of the forecast model is evaluated using objective scores and case studies that highlight its benefits and weaknesses.},

	abstract = {SURFEX is a new externalized land and ocean surface platform that describes the surface fluxes and the evolution of four types of surface: nature, town, inland water and ocean. It can be run either coupled or in offline mode. It is mostly based on pre-existing, well validated scientific models. It can be used in offline mode (from point scale to global runs) or fully coupled with an atmospheric model. SURFEX is able to simulate fluxes of carbon dioxide, chemical species, continental aerosols, sea salt and snow particles. It also includes a data assimilation module. The main principles of the organization of the surface are described first. Then, a survey is made of the scientific module (including the coupling strategy). Finally the main applications of the code are summarized. The current applications are extremely diverse, ranging from surface monitoring and hydrology to numerical weather prediction and global climate simulations. The validation work undertaken shows that replacing the pre-existing surface models by SURFEX in these applications is usually associated with improved skill, as the numerous scientific developments contained in this community code are used to good advantage.},
