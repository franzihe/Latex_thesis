  Abstract                 = {The aim of this article is to describe the reference configuration of the convection-permitting numerical weather prediction (NWP) model HARMONIE-AROME, which is used for operational short-range weather forecasts in Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Ireland, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, and Sweden. It is developed, maintained, and validated as part of the shared ALADIN–HIRLAM system by a collaboration of 26 countries in Europe and northern Africa on short-range mesoscale NWP. HARMONIE–AROME is based on the model AROME developed within the ALADIN consortium. Along with the joint modeling framework, AROME was implemented and utilized in both northern and southern European conditions by the above listed countries, and this activity has led to extensive updates to the model’s physical parameterizations. In this paper the authors present the differences in model dynamics and physical parameterizations compared with AROME, as well as important configuration choices of the reference, such as lateral boundary conditions, model levels, horizontal resolution, model time step, as well as topography, physiography, and aerosol databases used. Separate documentation will be provided for the atmospheric and surface data-assimilation algorithms and observation types used, as well as a separate description of the ensemble prediction system based on HARMONIE–AROME, which is called HarmonEPS.},

  Abstract                 = {Cirrus clouds have a profound impact on the radiation balance of the Earth–atmosphere system. Accurate representation of their radiative properties is critical to understanding climate and predicting climate change. This paper casts the split-window cirrus cloud retrieval technique in an optimal estimation framework facilitating direct inclusion of explicit cloud boundary information from complementary sensors as well as providing a suite of diagnostic tools for evaluating the dominant sources of uncertainty in all retrieved quantities. Errors in retrieved microphysical properties are used to determine the resulting errors in the calculation of global-scale radiative budgets. Uncertainties in optical depth and effective radius are found to diminish from ∼45\% and ∼80\%, respectively, in the absence of explicit cloud boundary information to ∼15\% and ∼60\% when accurate radar-based or lidar-based estimates are included. It is demonstrated that the improvements to cirrus cloud optical properties afforded by accurate cloud boundary information may lead to as much as a factor of 3 increase in the accuracy to which their impact on the Earth's radiative balance can be modeled. Colocated infrared radiances from the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument aboard the Earth Observing System (EOS) Aqua satellite and cloud radar observations from the CloudSat satellite will soon allow the retrieval presented here to be integrated into an operational retrieval of the vertical distribution of cloud properties on a global scale.},

  Abstract                 = {Estimates of snowfall rate as derived from radar reflectivities alone are non-unique. Different combinations of snowflake microphysical properties and particle fall speeds can conspire to produce nearly identical snowfall rates for given radar reflectivity signatures. Such ambiguities can result in retrieval uncertainties on the order of 100–200 \% for individual events. Here, we use observations of particle size distribution (PSD), fall speed, and snowflake habit from the Multi-Angle Snowflake Camera (MASC) to constrain estimates of snowfall derived from Ka-band ARM zenith radar (KAZR) measurements at the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) North Slope Alaska (NSA) Climate Research Facility site at Barrow. MASC measurements of microphysical properties with uncertainties are introduced into a modified form of the optimal-estimation CloudSat snowfall algorithm (2C-SNOW-PROFILE) via the a priori guess and variance terms. Use of the MASC fall speed, MASC PSD, and CloudSat snow particle model as base assumptions resulted in retrieved total accumulations with a −18 \% difference relative to nearby National Weather Service (NWS) observations over five snow events. The average error was 36 \% for the individual events. Use of different but reasonable combinations of retrieval assumptions resulted in estimated snowfall accumulations with differences ranging from −64 to +122 \% for the same storm events. Retrieved snowfall rates were particularly sensitive to assumed fall speed and habit, suggesting that in situ measurements can help to constrain key snowfall retrieval uncertainties. More accurate knowledge of these properties dependent upon location and meteorological conditions should help refine and improve ground- and space-based radar estimates of snowfall.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper introduces a radiative transfer model for the 9.6-μm ozone band that specifically matches the TIROS operational vertical sounder (TOVS) channel 9. The model is based on a spectral Malkmus band model for transmission. Band parameters were calculated by comparing to MODTRAN3 derived radiances. The effect of pressure on absorption is dealt with using a four-parameter approximation, and the improvements of this approximation over the more common Van de Hulst-Curtis-Godson scaling approximation are assessed. While this new model is exploited in the development of the retrieval described in this paper, the result has wider applicability to ozone climate problems requiring calculation of the radiative forcing associated with changing ozone. A two-layer version of the radiative transfer model is implemented in a retrieval scheme to obtain total ozone amounts from radiances measured by the TOVS instrument. Because the TOVS ozone channel is mainly sensitive to lower stratospheric ozone, ozone columns of the upper layer (above 30 hPa and with mean pressure of 10 hPa) are prescribed as a function of latitude. Ozone columns of the lower layer (mean pressure of 105 hPa) are then retrieved. The retrieval is based on a nonlinear optimal estimation algorithm and provides definition of error characteristics for every retrieval, which makes it possible to obtain a spatial distribution of the errors in the retrieval together with the spatial distribution of the retrieved total ozone column itself. This global distribution of the retrieval error and also of the contribution of a priori knowledge to the retrieval is presented to provide a validity of the ozone retrievals. Total ozone mapping spectrometer (TOMS) statistics are used as a priori information in the retrieval, and the 40-layer model is used to estimate the forward model error of the two-layer model. Comparisons of ozone retrievals for 1989 with TOMS total ozone measurements show good agreement both in time and in space with a rms difference between 1\% and 3\% for zonal means and 10\% for global gridded measurements.},

  Abstract                 = {A method of remotely sensing integrated cloud liquid water over the oceans using spaceborne passive measurements from the special sensor microwave/imager (SSM/I) is described. The technique is comprised of a simple physical model that uses the 19.35- and 37-GHz channels of the SSM/I. The most comprehensive validation to date of cloud liquid water estimated from satellites is presented. This is accomplished through a comparison to independent ground-based microwave radiometer measurements of liquid water on San Nicolas Island, over the North Sea, and on Kwajalein and Saipan Islands in the western Pacific. In areas of marine stratocumulus clouds off the coast of California a further comparison is made to liquid water inferred from advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) visible reflectance measurements. The results are also compared qualitatively with near-coincident satellite imagery and with other existing microwave methods in selected regions. These comparisons indicate that the liquid water amounts derived from the simple scheme are consistent with the ground-based measurements for nonprecipitating cloud systems in the subtropics and middle to high latitudes. The comparison in the tropics, however, was less conclusive. Nevertheless, the retrieval method appears to have general applicability over most areas of the global oceans. An observational measure of the minimum uncertainty in the retrievals is determined in a limited number of known cloud-free areas, where the liquid water amounts are found to have a low variability of 0.016 kg m−2. A simple sensitivity and error analysis suggests that the liquid water estimates have a theoretical relative error typically ranging from about 25\% to near 40\% depending on the atmospheric/surface conditions and on the amount of liquid water present in the cloud. For the global oceans as a whole the average cloud liquid water is determined to be about 0.08 kg m−2. The major conclusion of this paper is that reasonably accurate amounts of cloud liquid water can be retrieved from SSM/I observations for nonprecipitating cloud systems, particularly in areas of persistent stratocumulus clouds, with less accurate retrievals in tropical regions.},

  Abstract                 = {Radar Doppler spectra measurements are exploited to study a riming event when precipitating ice from a seeder cloud sediment through a supercooled liquid water (SLW) layer. The focus is on the "golden sample" case study for this type of analysis based on observations collected during the deployment of the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program's (ARM) mobile facility AMF2 at Hyytiälä, Finland, during the Biogenic Aerosols – Effects on Clouds and Climate (BAECC) field campaign. The presented analysis of the height evolution of the radar Doppler spectra is a state-of-the-art retrieval with profiling cloud radars in SLW layers beyond the traditional use of spectral moments. Dynamical effects are considered by following the particle population evolution along slanted tracks that are caused by horizontal advection of the cloud under wind shear conditions. In the SLW layer, the identified liquid peak is used as an air motion tracer to correct the Doppler spectra for vertical air motion and the ice peak is used to study the radar profiles of rimed particles. A 1-D steady-state bin microphysical model is constrained using the SLW and air motion profiles and cloud top radar observations. The observed radar moment profiles of the rimed snow can be simulated reasonably well by the model, but not without making several assumptions about the ice particle concentration and the relative role of deposition and aggregation. This suggests that in situ observations of key ice properties are needed to complement the profiling radar observations before process-oriented studies can effectively evaluate ice microphysical parameterizations.},

  Abstract                 = {The conservation and distribution of water substance in atmospheric circulations is considered within a frame of continuity principles, model air flows, and models of microphysical processes. The simplest considerations of precipitation involve its vertical distribution in an updraft column, where condensate appears immediately as precipitation with uniform terminal fallspeed. The study also treats steady two-dimensional air circulations in which time-dependent distributions of water vapor, cloud and precipitation respond to model microphysical processes.The approach throughout is essentially kinematic, although results provide numerous insights into the dynamical properties of a cloudy or stormy atmosphere. Water distributions are explained in relation to the air’s horizontal divergence, vertical velocity and compressibility, and physical pictures are presented frequently. The findings are compared with various observations on precipitating weather systems.Detailed summaries of this paper by Sections are presented in Sections 1 and 15.},

  Abstract                 = {A new method for retrieving rainfall profiles from a spaceborne radar is introduced. As a result of the frequencies necessary in spaceborne radar applications, attenuation by both rainfall and liquid cloud particles is nonnegligible and must be accurately accounted for before quantitative rainfall estimates can be made. The proposed method is based on the minimization of a cost function that allows one to account for attenuation at each level directly in the iteration process. In addition, the algorithm does not invoke the Rayleigh approximation and is, therefore, applicable at wavelengths characteristic of spaceborne radars. The method is flexible with regard to the parameters to be retrieved and is well-suited for the addition of measurements from other sensors, such as a passive microwave radiometer, to constrain the retrieval. Preliminary results, using simplified assumptions of drop size distribution and particle shape, illustrate the utility of the algorithm provided the attenuation is not severe. At the frequency of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) precipitation radar (14 GHz), synthetic retrievals are accurate to within 20\% for rain rates up to 40 mm h−1. On the other hand, at 94 GHz, the frequency of the CloudSat cloud profiling radar, attenuation effects are too severe at rain rates greater than 1.5 mm h−1, suggesting the need for additional information to constrain the retrieval. Such information might come in the form of a path-integrated attenuation (PIA) derived from surface echo measurements or, alternatively, a precipitation water path (PWP) estimate from a passive microwave radiometer. Addition of a simple PWP constraint yields improvements in the retrieved rainfall profiles from both instruments when attenuation is severe. At 94 GHz, in particular, it is found that accurate quantitative rainfall estimates can be made provided the near-surface rain rate does not exceed 10 mm h−1.},

  Abstract                 = {The authors investigate whether radar remote sensing of a certain class of ice clouds allows for characterization of the precipitation rates and aggregation processes. The NASA DC-8 collected the measurements in tropical anvils during July and August 2007 as part of the Tropical Composition, Cloud and Climate Coupling (TC4) experiment. Measured hydrometeor size distributions are used to estimate precipitation rates (P) and to solve the hydrodynamical collection equation. These distributions are also used to estimate radar reflectivity factors (Z) and Doppler velocities (Vd) at W, Ka, and Ku bands. Optimal estimation techniques are then used to estimate the uncertainty in retrieving P and aggregation rates (A) from combinations of Z and Vd. It is found that diagnosing information about A requires significant averaging and that a dual-frequency combination of W and Ka bands seems to provide the most information for the ice clouds sampled during TC4. Furthermore, the addition of Vd with expected uncertainty contributes little to the microphysical retrieval of either P or A. It is also shown that accounting for uncertainty in ice microphysical bulk density dominates the retrieval uncertainty in both P and A causing, for instance, the instantaneous uncertainty in retrieved P to increase from {\textasciitilde}30\% to {\textasciitilde}200\%.},

The core of the model is based on the convection-permitting Applications of Research to Operations at Mesoscale (AROME) model developed by Météo-France. In this paper the specific modifications and updates that have been made to suit advanced high-resolution weather forecasts over the Nordic regions are described. This includes modifications in the surface drag description, microphysics, snow assimilation, as well as an update of the ecosystem and surface parameter description. Novel observation types are introduced in the operational runs, including ground-based Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) observations and radar reflectivity data from the Norwegian and Swedish radar networks. After almost two years’ worth of experience with the AROME-MetCoOp model, the model’s sensitivities to the use of specific parameterization settings are characterized and the forecast skills demonstrating the benefit as compared with the global European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts’ Integrated Forecasting System (ECMWF-IFS) are evaluated. Furthermore, case studies are provided to demonstrate the ability of the model to capture extreme precipitation and wind events.},

  Abstract                 = {A method is presented for determining the optical thickness and effective particle radius of stratiform cloud layers from reflected solar radiation measurements. A detailed study is presented which shows that the cloud optical thickness (τc) and effective particle radius (re) of water clouds can be determined solely from reflection function measurements at 0.75 and 2.16 μm, provided τc ≳ 4 and re ≳ 6 μm. For optically thin clouds the retrieval becomes ambiguous, resulting in two possible solutions for the effective radius and optical thickness. Adding a third channel near 1.65 μm does not improve the situation noticeably, whereas the addition of a channel near 3.70 μm reduces the ambiguity in deriving the effective radius. The effective radius determined by the above procedure corresponds to the droplet radius at some optical depth within the cloud layer. For clouds having τc ≳ 8, the effective radius determined using the 0.75 and 2.16 μm channels can be regarded as 85\%–95\% of the radius at cloud top, which corresponds in turn to an optical depth 20\%–40\% of the total optical thickness of the cloud layer.},

  Abstract                 = {Accurate snowfall estimates are important for both weather and climate applications. Ground-based weather radars and space-based satellite sensors are often used as viable alternatives to rain gauges to estimate precipitation in this context. In particular, the Cloud Profiling Radar (CPR) on board CloudSat is proving to be a useful tool to map snowfall globally, in part due to its high sensitivity to light precipitation and its ability to provide near-global vertical structure. CloudSat snowfall estimates play a particularly important role in the high-latitude regions as other ground-based observations become sparse and passive satellite sensors suffer from inherent limitations. In this paper, snowfall estimates from two observing systems – Swerad, the Swedish national weather radar network, and CloudSat – are compared. Swerad offers a well-calibrated data set of precipitation rates with high spatial and temporal resolution, at very high latitudes. The measurements are anchored to rain gauges and provide valuable insights into the usefulness of CloudSat CPR's snowfall estimates in the polar regions. In total, 7.2 × 105 matchups of CloudSat and Swerad observations from 2008 through 2010 were intercompared, covering all but the summer months (June to September). The intercomparison shows encouraging agreement between the two observing systems despite their different sensitivities and user applications. The best agreement is observed when CloudSat passes close to a Swerad station (46–82 km), where the observational conditions for both systems are comparable. Larger disagreements outside this range suggest that both platforms have difficulty with shallow snow but for different reasons. The correlation between Swerad and CloudSat degrades with increasing distance from the nearest Swerad station, as Swerad's sensitivity decreases as a function of distance. Swerad also tends to overshoot low-level precipitating systems further away from the station, leading to an underestimation of snowfall rate and occasionally to missing precipitation altogether. Several statistical metrics – including the probability of detection, false alarm rate, hit rate, and Pierce's skill score – are calculated. The sensitivity of these metrics to the snowfall rate, as well as to the distance from the nearest radar station, are summarised. This highlights the strengths and the limitations of both observing systems at the lower and upper ends of the snowfall distributions as well as the range of uncertainties that can be expected from these systems in high-latitude regions.},

  Abstract                 = {On average, the models in the Fifth Climate Model Intercomparison Project archive predict an increase in Antarctic precipitation from 5.5 to 24.5 \% between 1986–2005 and 2080–2099, depending on greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. This translates into a moderation of future sea level rise ranging from −19 to −71 mm between 2006 and 2099. However, comparison with CloudSat and ERA-Interim data show that almost all the models overestimate current Antarctic precipitation, some by more than 100 \%. If only the models that agree with CloudSat data within 20 \% of error are considered, larger precipitation changes (from 7.4 to 29.3 \%) and impact on sea level (from −25 to −85 mm) are predicted. A common practice of averaging all models to evaluate climate projections thus leads to a significant underestimation of the contribution of Antarctic precipitation to future sea level. Models simulate, on average, a 7.4 \%/°C precipitation change with surface temperature warming. The models in better agreement with CloudSat observations for Antarctic snowfall predict, on average, larger temperature and Antarctic sea ice cover changes, which could explain the larger changes in Antarctic precipitation simulated by these models. The agreement between the models, CloudSat data and ERA-Interim is generally less in the interior of Antarctica than at the peripheries, but the interior is also where climate change will induce the smallest absolute change in precipitation. About three-quarters of the impact on sea level will result from precipitation change over the half most peripheral and lowest elevation part of the surface of Antarctica.},

  Abstract                 = {A new method to automatically classify solid hydrometeors based on Multi-Angle Snowflake Camera (MASC) images is presented. For each individual image, the method relies on the calculation of a set of geometric and texture-based descriptors to simultaneously identify the hydrometeor type (among six predefined classes), estimate the degree of riming and detect melting snow. The classification tasks are achieved by means of a regularized multinomial logistic regression (MLR) model trained over more than 3000 MASC images manually labeled by visual inspection. In a second step, the probabilistic information provided by the MLR is weighed on the three stereoscopic views of the MASC in order to assign a unique label to each hydrometeor. The accuracy and robustness of the proposed algorithm is evaluated on data collected in the Swiss Alps and in Antarctica. The algorithm achieves high performance, with a hydrometeor-type classification accuracy and Heidke skill score of 95 \% and 0.93, respectively. The degree of riming is evaluated by introducing a riming index ranging between zero (no riming) and one (graupel) and characterized by a probable error of 5.5 \%. A validation study is conducted through a comparison with an existing classification method based on two-dimensional video disdrometer (2DVD) data and shows that the two methods are consistent.},

Precipitation measurements have a well-documented and mostly wind-dependent bias which is especially apparent during solid precipitation events. The resulting inaccuracy in precipitation data remains an area of concern in quantifying regional and global climate trends. As a high-latitude country, Norway has many solid precipitation events often accompanied by high wind speeds where the current adjustment functions have only limited validity. The presented study aims at improving the quality of solid precipitation data. In a comprehensive field experiment, precipitation data of standard automatic gauges are compared with data of a reference gauge surrounded by a double fence construction to minimize wind impact. Additional meteorological parameters are measured at the test site, allowing for an in-depth analysis of high-temporal-resolution precipitation data. The goal is to develop new adjustment functions for solid precipitation measurements which account for Norway's typical climate and are suitable for automated measurements. Measurements began in winter 2010/2011 at the alpine test site in southern Norway (chosen after a pre-study in 2009/2010) and will continue for two more winters. In this paper, the test site and its instrumentation are described and preliminary results are presented.},
