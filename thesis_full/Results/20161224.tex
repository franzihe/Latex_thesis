%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The box-whisker-plot in \Cref{fig:boxplt24} shows an uncertainty shortly after initialisation of the ten forecast members. All members have a different opinion of the precipitation amount, since the difference between the \SIrange{25}{75}{\percent} is wide spread.
The ensemble mean is always higher than the median and already after \SI{12}{\hour} forecast time is the median closer to the lower percentile. Also, all upper whiskers are taller than the lower ones, which would follow that the ensemble members vary amongst the most positive quartile and that it is very similar for the least positive quartile group.
\\
\textcolor{red}{DISCUSSION! The uncertainty shortly after the initialisation time might be associated with the spin up time of the precipitation value in the model. }
