In this chapter the results of the optimal estimation retrieval and the regional mesoscale forecast model are presented. On the basis of the methodology described in \Cref{ch:Methods} it should be evaluated if a regional mesoscale forecast model prognoses the same snowfall amount as observed with the ground based remote sensing at Haukeliseter. All days of the seven day event showed their own significances. Since some patterns repeated during these days the most interesting days, \SIlist{21;24;25}{\dec}, are picked and studied in more detail.

%\begin{itemize}
% \item \SI{21}{\dec} has convective storm from \SIrange{9}{13}{\UTC} then pulsing
% \item on \SI{23}{\dec} convective storm from \SIrange{16}{00}{\UTC} 
% \item connection with wind \Cref{fig:wind21,fig:wind22,fig:wind23,fig:wind24,fig:wind25,fig:wind26}% when pulsing event then wind observations from N\-W to S\-W
% %\item $\rightarrow$ when wind from S\-S\-W to S\-E then convective storm habit
% \item \textbf{pick interesting days:}
% 	\begin{itemize}
% 	\item \SI{21}{\dec}, because change from convective storm to pulsing event $\rightarrow$ put in the connection with wind. MEPS does catch convective part, but not as strong. High SWC$_\textit{MEPS}$ at \SI{20}{\UTC}
% %    \item \SI{22}{\dec}, because SWC$_\mathit{RETRIEVAL}$ almost same as SWC$_\mathit{MEPS}$, only \SI{2}{\hour} shift
%     \item \SI{24}{\dec}, because SWC$_\mathit{MEPS}$ almost as pulsing as SWC$_\mathit{RETRIEVAL}$ just not as strong. Also overestimation of surface snowfall from MEPS \Cref{fig:sfc_acc24}. All 10 ensemble members have pulsing. Most intense in pulsing events: control, EM1, EM4, EM5, EM7 (not shown).
% %    \item \SI{25}{\dec}, because MEPS covers the LWC at the same time as retrieval, but the retrieval does not see the snow above $\rightarrow$ weakness of retrieval is shown even though weak. See: \Cref{fig:SWC25} and \ref{fig:LWC25}. Also it has the overestimation at the surface \Cref{fig:sfc_acc25}
%     \item \SI{26}{\dec} almost correct forecasted peak, all three systems recognise stop of precipitation (retrieval a little earlier), MEPS overestimates after 12h forecast, MEPS has stronger SWP values than retrieval, no relation between wind and scatter
% 	\end{itemize}
% \item \textbf{Research question:}  \\ Does a regional mesoscale model catch the same snowfall amount as observed at a certain location?

% Even though the model might have performed well for some days it might be interesting to investigate the same results with an hourly time resolution of all ten ensemble members. Another interesting approach could also be to perturb the ensemble members and initialise them in a different way to see if the actual forecast performed best.
