In this chapter the results of the surface observation, the optimal estimation retrieval and the regional mesoscale forecast model are presented. On the basis of the methodology described in \Cref{ch:Methods} it should be evaluated if a regional mesoscale forecast model prognoses the same synoptical patterns as observed at the measurement site. Also, vertical SWC forecasted by MEPS is being verified with the retrieved SWC at Haukeliseter.

% Even though the model might have performed well for some days it might be interesting to investigate the same results with an hourly time resolution of all ten ensemble members. Another interesting approach could also be to perturb the ensemble members and initialise them in a different way to see if the actual forecast performed best.
