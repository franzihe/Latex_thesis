The purpose of this Chapter is to understand if a regional mesoscale forecast model prognoses the same snowfall amount observed with the ground based remote sensing described in \Cref{ch:Methods}. All days of the seven day event showed their own significances. Since some patterns repeated during these days the most interesting days, \SIlist{21;24;26}{\dec} are picked and analysed in the next sections.
%ensemble member \numlist{0;1} every hour; ensemble member \numrange{2}{10} every three hours. \\

\begin{itemize}
	% \item \SI{21}{\dec} has convective storm from \SIrange{9}{13}{\UTC} then pulsing
	% \item on \SI{23}{\dec} convective storm from \SIrange{16}{00}{\UTC} 
	% \item connection with wind \Cref{fig:wind21,fig:wind22,fig:wind23,fig:wind24,fig:wind25,fig:wind26}% when pulsing event then wind observations from N\-W to S\-W
	% %\item $\rightarrow$ when wind from S\-S\-W to S\-E then convective storm habit
	\item \textbf{pick interesting days:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \SI{21}{\dec}, because change from convective storm to pulsing event $\rightarrow$ put in the connection with wind. MEPS does catch convective part, but not as strong. High SWC$_\textit{MEPS}$ at \SI{20}{\UTC}
		%    \item \SI{22}{\dec}, because SWC$_\mathit{RETRIEVAL}$ almost same as SWC$_\mathit{MEPS}$, only \SI{2}{\hour} shift
		\item \SI{24}{\dec}, because SWC$_\mathit{MEPS}$ almost as pulsing as SWC$_\mathit{RETRIEVAL}$ just not as strong. Also overestimation of surface snowfall from MEPS \Cref{fig:sfc_acc24}. All 10 ensemble members have pulsing. Most intense in pulsing events: control, EM1, EM4, EM5, EM7 (not shown).
		%    \item \SI{25}{\dec}, because MEPS covers the LWC at the same time as retrieval, but the retrieval does not see the snow above $\rightarrow$ weakness of retrieval is shown even though weak. See: \Cref{fig:SWC25} and \ref{fig:LWC25}. Also it has the overestimation at the surface \Cref{fig:sfc_acc25}
		\item \SI{26}{\dec} almost correct forecasted peak, all three systems recognise stop of precipitation (retrieval a little earlier), MEPS overestimates after 12h forecast, MEPS has stronger SWP values than retrieval, no relation between wind and scatter
	\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Research question:}  \\ Does a regional mesoscale model catch the same snowfall amount as observed at a certain location?
\end{itemize}
