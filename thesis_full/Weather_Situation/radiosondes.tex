\section{Radiosonde from Stavanger} \label{sec:Radiosonde}
The \Cref{app:sounding} includes images of vertical temperature profiles of Radiosondes from Stavanger, represented in a Skew-T log-P diagram. The vertical profiles extend from surface up to \SI{300}{\hPa}. (Note, that the representation of the vertical scale (in \SI{}{\metre}) differs with each sounding from day to day.)
\\
The vertical temperature distribution will identify the stability of the atmosphere and give information on convection and thickness of clouds. Furthermore, warm air and cold air advection can be identified by observing the change of wind with height.
\\
Black and green line represent the atmospheric and dew-point temperature, respectively.
