\section{Observations at the weather mast}
\label{sec:loc_obs}
The large scale synoptic analysis will be related to the local weather  observations at Haukeliseter. 
\\
\SI{60}{\minute} accumulation is presented as bars in \Cref{fig:TPU} and will show the continuous precipitation at Haukeliseter during the extreme event. The possible change of precipitation will be investigated with the temperature. Snow fall is likely for temperatures up to \SI{2}{\celsius}. The intensity of the storm can be classified by the hourly averaged wind speed and direction as wind barbs in \SI{}{\mPs}.
To understand which damage a storm can have, \cite{faeraas_urd_2016} released a table to associate wind strength with damage (see \Cref{tab:wind}).
