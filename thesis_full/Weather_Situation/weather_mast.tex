\section{Observations at the weather mast}
\label{sec:loc_obs}
%The large scale synoptic analysis will be related to the local weather  observations at Haukeliseter. 
It is a primary goal of this work to relate the local weather observations from the WMO site at Haukeliseter to the synoptic scale structure and the additional measurements taken at Haukeliseter during the winter of 2016/2017.
\\
Examples of the \SI{60}{\minute} precipitation accumulation from the double fence rain gauge are presented in \Cref{fig:TPU} to document the continuous precipitation at Haukeliseter during the extreme event.

%The possible change of precipitation will be investigated with the temperature. 
The temperature evolution will be used to investigate possible changes in the type of precipitation.

Snowfall is likely for temperatures up to \SI{2}{\celsius}. The intensity of the storm can be classified by the hourly averaged wind speed and direction as wind barbs in \SI{}{\mPs}.
To understand which damage a storm can have, \cite{faeraas_urd_2016} released a table to associate wind strength with damage (see \Cref{tab:wind}).
