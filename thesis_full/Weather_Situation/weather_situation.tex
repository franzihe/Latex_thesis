This extreme weather event is chosen since MEPS just became operational and in addition surface snow instruments where installed to profile the vertical at Haukeliseter. Preliminary test showed the overestimation of snow accumulation by MEPS compared to the measurements at the ground. Furthermore, was changed the phase between the precipitation.  
\\
The next sections will give a definition of an extreme weather, a description of the different weather maps, and a synoptic interpretation of the storm and why mixed phase precipitation was observed at Haukeliseter. \\
Before the analysis each weather maps' purpose  will be presented to understand the connections between them. For this, the ECMWF ...blabla product... so many grid degree ...  is processed.
